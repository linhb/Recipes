This is another timing thing for me but it works. \r\n\r\nI always take my steaks out of the fridge at least 30 minutes before I have to cook them and allow them to marinate in a half cup olive oil, 4 tablespoons soy sauce and 4 teaspoons Grill Mates Montreal Steak Seasoning. That marinade recipe is for two good sized steaks but you can easily double it if needed. \r\n\r\nThis gives me time to get my cast ironed skillet and oven heated up and gives the steak time to come to room temperature.\r\nStep 3\r\nSear the Steaks before you Cook Them in The Oven: To cook a steak in the oven that appears to have been cooked on the grill you need to sear it. I prefer to sear mine on the burner by heating the pan over medium high heat and then adding the steaks and turning them after about 4-5 minutes and then searing the other side for an equal amount of time but you could choose to sear them under the broiler. Some people prefer the broiler method because they do not have to turn them. They will sear on both sides because the heat from the broiler and the heat from the pan works together to sear both sides. Either way you are well on your way to cooking a great steak in the oven.\r\nStep 4\r\nCook Steak in The Oven: To cook steak in the oven you have two choices. \r\n\r\nYou can cook them quickly at 450 degrees or you can cook a steak in the oven at 325 degrees. Either way works great. I think timing is everything when it comes to cooking. \r\n\r\nIf I'm just frying potatoes to go with them I set the oven at 450 degrees and they are cooked to a perfect medium in 10 to 12 minutes.\r\n\r\nBut if I'm making baked potatoes I set the oven at 325 degrees which allows them to cook to a perfect medium in 25 to 30 minutes. You just choose which method works best for you and transfer your pan directly into the preheated oven.\r\n"}}

Marinate Steaks to Cook in The Oven: To cook steak in the oven that has great flavor and is tender it is best to marinate them. This is another timing thing for me but it works. 

I always take my steaks out of the fridge at least 30 minutes before I have to cook them and allow them to marinate in a half cup olive oil, 4 tablespoons soy sauce and 4 teaspoons Grill Mates Montreal Steak Seasoning. That marinade recipe is for two good sized steaks but you can easily double it if needed. 

This gives me time to get my cast ironed skillet and oven heated up and gives the steak time to come to room temperature.
Step 3
Sear the Steaks before you Cook Them in The Oven: To cook a steak in the oven that appears to have been cooked on the grill you need to sear it. I prefer to sear mine on the burner by heating the pan over medium high heat and then adding the steaks and turning them after about 4-5 minutes and then searing the other side for an equal amount of time but you could choose to sear them under the broiler. Some people prefer the broiler method because they do not have to turn them. They will sear on both sides because the heat from the broiler and the heat from the pan works together to sear both sides. Either way you are well on your way to cooking a great steak in the oven.
Step 4
Cook Steak in The Oven: To cook steak in the oven you have two choices. 

You can cook them quickly at 450 degrees or you can cook a steak in the oven at 325 degrees. Either way works great. I think timing is everything when it comes to cooking. 

If I''m just frying potatoes to go with them I set the oven at 450 degrees and they are cooked to a perfect medium in 10 to 12 minutes.

But if I''m making baked potatoes I set the oven at 325 degrees which allows them to cook to a perfect medium in 25 to 30 minutes. You just choose which method works best for you and transfer your pan directly into the preheated oven.

Nguyên liệu: 
Làm từng ít một với khoảng 1 kg thịt. 
1. Chọn thịt heo nạc thăn lưng. 
Thịt thăn lưng khi thái ra có dạng miếng dài, lóc bỏ phần mỡ, gân, cho thật sạch, cắt thịt thành từng khúc khoảng 10cm, 
2. Cho thịt vào dĩa sâu lòng, hấp cho thịt chín ( Làm thịt chà bông nên hấp thịt đừng nên luộc, vì nếu luộc vị thịt chà bông sẽ mất đi chất ngọt của thịt 
3. Sau khi thịt chín để nguội , dùng một cái chày hoặc một vỏ chai sạch đập nhẹ lên khối thịt cho tơi mềm ra rồi mới tước thành sợi cỡ hơn như cây tăm là được. Không xé quá nhỏ sẽ khó chà thành bông. 
Không giã thịt bằng chày cối, thịt sẽ dập nát ra chứ không thành dạng bông được. 
4. Cho thịt đã tước nhỏ vào trong một chảo dày, cho vào 1 muỗng cà phê muối / 1 kg thịt hoặc 1 muỗng súp nước mắm. 
Bắc lên bếp, mở nhỏ lửa cho vừa nóng ấm chảo, không để lửa lớn, vì lửa lớn thịt sẽ mau khô, nhưng sẽ ngã màu vàng cháy mất đẹp. Dùng đũa tre . Đảo thịt đều tay và liên tục khoảng hơn mười phút, nếm thử sợi thịt xem vị mặn vừa khẩu vị chưa rồi mới quyết định cho thêm ít muối hoặc nước mắm rồi đảo tiếp cho đến khi sợi thịt thật khô ráo . 
Thử bằng cách vo nát vài sợi thịt giữa hai đầu ngón tay thấy thịt tơi ra dạng bông mà không gãy nát là được. 

Nếu đảo lâu trên chảo, chà bông sẽ bông ra như dạng bông gòn. 
Khi đem cất vào hũ hay hộp đậy kín, nhớ đừng ép thịt chà bông nhiều quá, hãy để thịt tơi ra tự nhiên, và nhớ đậy kín thịt. 
Chú ý:
 Thịt chà bông làm cũng phải có chút kinh nghiệm, 
1- Là đừng để lửa to quá, 
2- Phải đão thịt thường xuyên, để thịt được bông tơi ra 
3- Nên chọn thịt tươi, thì thịt mới bông ra đẹp ra, và mùi vị cũng ngon hơn là mua thịt không được tươi. 
4- Nên cẩn thận trông chừng nếu làm khô quá thì thịt không ngon nhưng còn ướt quá thì không để lâu được. 

Món thịt cà bông dùng với cháo trắng, bánh mì hay cơm rất ngon

Method

In a large bowl, combine the glutinous rice flour with Pandan juice and knead lightly. Pinch a small piece of the dough (about 40 g) and drop it into boiling water. When the dough rises up the surface, remove it with a slotted spoon and shake off the excess water. Mix it back into the main dough and knead well to form smooth dough. Cover the dough and set aside for about 15 minutes.

Mix the grated coconut with a pinch of salt and steam for about 2 - 3 minutes and let it cool completely.

Bring a pot of water to boil. Pinch a small piece of dough (about 15 g each) and flatten lightly. Fill the center of the dough with palm sugar. Roll them in your palm to form a smooth ball and cook the glutinous rice balls in the boiling water. When the rice balls float to the surface, remove them with a slotted spoon and shake off the excess water.

Coat the rice balls with grated coconut and serve immediately.

Note: To make the Pandan Juice. Blend 10 Pandan leaves with 220 ml water.

Gạo và đỗ vo thật sạch rồi ngâm nước cho nở ra; nếu ngâm nước lạnh thì gạo phải ngâm 7, 8h mới được, đỗ khoảng 2h; còn nếu ngâm nước ấm thì gạo độ 1h, đỗ 30'. Nhung thuc su me chưa ngam nuoc am bao gio, day la me nghe noi  the thoi, con me toan ngam nuoc lanh, quen roi, cho an toan. Khi đỗ đã nở hết xối nước kỹ cho thật hết nước ngâm đỗ đi, để thật ráo nước rồi mang đỗ đồ lên, tức là làm cho đỗ chín kỹ bằng hơi nước chứ không phải bằng nước nhé, để đảm bảo đỗ chín mà vẫn khô không bị ướt. Con còn nhớ cái chõ ở nhà mẹ hay đồ xôi không, không biết ở bên đấy có loại dụng cụ như thế không, không có thì con đồ bằng cái gì. Sau khi đỗ đã chín thật kỹ (tức là thật mềm rồi) cho đỗ vào cối lấy chày giã thật kỹ cho đỗ thật nhuyễn ra, chú ý phải giã ngay khi đỗ còn thật nóng thì mới giã đỗ thật nhuyễn được, khi đỗ đã nguội rồi khó giã nhuyễn lắm và như vậy xôi không ngon. Nếu con không có cối chày thì có thể cho đỗ vào một cái bát to hoặc cái xoong, rồi dùng thìa to hoặc muôi múc canh đánh thật nhuyễn ra cũng được. Sau khi đỗ đã thật nhuyễn rồi thì nắm lại thành từng nắm thật chặt, con nắm bằng tay thì mỗi nắm to khoảng bằng quả bóng tennis ấy. Sau đó để cho các nắm đỗ này nguội rồi thì lại lấy dao thái tơi ra. Con có nhớ cách các bà hàng xôi ở VN thái đỗ vào xôi xéo hoặc xôi ngô không? Tức là cầm dao thái đỗ thành từng lát rất mỏng ấy, họ lia dao rất nhanh để các lát đỗ rất mỏng, như vậy thì đỗ mới thật mịn ăn mới ngon. Công đoạn này nghe có vẻ thừa vì đã nắm vào rồi lại thái ra nhưng thực ra không thừa đâu con nhé vì phải làm như vậy đỗ mới thật mịn được, bỏ qua công đoạn này dù đỗ có giã kỹ đến mấy cũng không thể mịn bằng được, xôi ăn kém ngon hẳn, vì vậy không nên bỏ qua! Tiếp đến là gạo sau khi ngâm xong cho hạt gạo nở hết cỡ rồi xóc lại bằng nước lã cho thật sạch nước ngâm vì nước ngâm lâu dễ bị chua mà, giai đoạn này không được bóp hạt gạo nữa nhé vì lúc này gạo rất mềm rồi mà bóp sẽ bị gẫy vỡ, xôi bị nát khong ngon và không đẹp, chỉ xóc nhẹ tay cho đi hết nước ngâm cho khỏi bị chua thôi nhé. Sau khi xóc gạo xong để gạo thật ráo nước, rắc một ít muối tinh vào gạo và trộn thật đều lên cho xôi hơi đậm, quên công đoạn này xôi sẽ bị nhạt đớ ra khong ngon đâu. Sau đó đổ chỗ đỗ đã thái tơi ra vào gạo này và dùng tay trộn thật đều đỗ và gạo với nhau rồi cho vào chõ đồ chín lên. Khi xôi gần chín rưới nước mỡ gà (mỡ gà thái miếng như miếng thịt lợn xào ấy rồi cho vào chảo rán lên để mỡ chảy ra, chú ý đừng để lửa to mà mỡ dễ cháy có mùi khét không ngon; khi miếng mỡ đã quắt lại hết là được, bỏ miếng tóp mỡ ấy đi, chỉ lấy nước mỡ rưới vào xôi thôi). Thường mẹ làm tỉ lệ: gạo 1kg, đỗ 0,5kg, mỡ gà 0,3kg. Tất nhiên nhiều mỡ quá thì bị ngấy cũng không ngon, nhưng ít mỡ quá thì xôi không đủ độ béo cũng không ngon. Loại xôi này rất ngon vì có cái dẻo của gạo nếp ngon, cái bùi của đỗ xanh đồ chín giã thật nhuyễn, cái béo và thơm của mỡ gà. Nhiều khi không có mỡ gà thì người ta cho mỡ lợn, nhưng mỡ lợn không ngon bằng mỡ gà vì mỡ gà thơm hơn. Món này mà nấu thành công mẹ nghĩ trên đời này không có ai không thích, kể cả người không bao giờ ăn đồ nếp như ba Hợp mà mẹ nấu ngon ba Hợp cũng thích và ăn rất nhiều. Mẹ nghĩ tây ăn chắc chúng nó cũng thích lắm. \r\n \r\n"}}

Cách làm:
Thịt nạc vai rửa sạch, băm nhỏ.
Cua rửa sạch, hấp chín, gỡ lấy thịt, vắt ráo nước
Mộc nhĩ ngâm nước nóng cho mềm, rửa sạch, cắt bỏ chân, vắt ráo nước, thái chỉ. Miến cắt khúc 2 cm (để khô, không ngâm nước).
Giã đỗ đãi rửa sạch, ép qua cho ráo nước, thái nhỏ. Hành khô bóc vỏ, băm nhỏ. Các loại rau nhặt rửa sạch, vẩy ráo nước. Ớt tươi rửa sạch, thái khoanh.
Đập trứng trộn đều với thịt, cua, mộc nhĩ, miến, giá đỗ, hành khô, ít nước mắm (chú ý không cho nhiều vì banh đa nem đã có độ mặn sẵn và khi ăn còn chấm nước mắm pha), đường, mì chính, hạt tiêu để làm nhân nem.
Bánh đa nem cắt bỏ rìa cứng xung quanh, nếu banh to thì cắt đôi và xoa nước hỗn hợp (gồm nước vôi trong, một ít đường, mì chính, bột đao trộn đều) vào mặt trái của bánh cho bánh mềm (không xoa lên mặt phải, không xoa ướt bánh dễ nhão). Xúc một thìa nhân đổ lên mặt trái bánh có xoa nước sẵn, xếp 2 bên mép bánh vào, cuốn tròn lại cho đều to hơn ngón tay cái, dài 5-6 cm.
Cho nhiều mỡ vào chảo, đun nóng già, thả mặt gấp của bánh xuống thành chảo (nếu mặt gấp quay lên bánh dễ bị bong (rán vàng mới lật trở mặt trên xuống rán tiếp). Khi bánh vàng đều vớt ra, để ráo mỡ, cắt mỗi chiếc làm 2-3 bày lên đĩa. Ăn nóng kèm với các loại rau, chấm nước mắm pha đường, mì chính, giấm, ớt, tỏi, hạt tiêu các vị hài hòa.
Yêu cầu thành phẩm:
Nem rán chín vàng đều, không cháy, không nứt vỡ, ăn giòn, mùi thơm đặc trưng, vị ngon ngọt, không mặn
Ghi chú: Cuốn nem không nên cuốn chặt tay vì khi rán nhân nem nở dễ nứt vỡ và chỉ đun vừa lửa nem mới chín đều.

Error! Cannot read or display file.

Nguyên liệu:

- một hộp bột water chestnut starch
- 6 chén nước =1.5 lít nước,
- 10 cọng lá dứa
- nước dừa
- nước đường
- đậu xanh nấu, tán nhuyễn

Cách làm:

Xay 10 lá dứa với 1.5 lít nước, vắt bỏ bả đong 6 chén nước và trộn chung với bột cho đến khi bột tan hết trong nước thì đem lên bếp quấy đều tay, nhỏ lửa đến khi chín thì bột trong và có màu xanh lá dứa rất đẹp thì để một chậu nước lanh, cái rổ và cái gì để ép bột thôi hoặc xài đồ ép khoai tây (lọai đế rời đừng mua ở IKEA lọai dính luôn).

Sau đó thì bỏ bánh lọt, nước đường, đậu xanh, đá vào mà măm thôi.

CACH LAM CHO BOT MIN:

- Dầu tiên đổ hộp bột ra cái tô to sau đó múc từng muỗng một rây qua cái thau hay cái nồi đựng nước dứa đó.

- Sau khi rây xong thì những cục to to sẽ còn lại, cho vào cái tô nhỏ hay cái chén, đổ nước dứa vào và quậy cho nó tan, đổ phần trên, rồi múc nước dứa quậy tiếp phần còn lại, rồi đổ phần đã tan vào nồi, rồi lại múc nước dứa quậy tiếp, cứ làm như thế cho đến khi nào chén bột tan hết.

- Vậy là xong và lấy muỗng quậy cho bột và nước dứa hòa tan vào nhau và bắt lên bếp khuấy thôi.

Ly chè này làm chỉ có lá dứa thôi nên nó bạc màu 



Sau này làm nhiều lần nên rút kinh nghiệm khi ngâm bột và nước dừa cho 1 giọt màu xanh vào là nó đẹp liền

Trộn bột

1 chén rưỡi bột gạo khô và 1/2 chén bột năng + 1 muỗng cafe bột nếp khô. 

- Trộn bột đều rồi pha với nước lã theo tỷ lệ 1 chén bột thì 1 chén rưỡi nước + muối ăn.

- Xửng cho nước vào nấu sôi lên, cho chén vào trước cho nóng. Còn bột thì bỏ vào ấm, hay cái bình có cái vòi đấy rồi mở nắp xửng ra và chế bột vào từng chén một. Làm bằng cái bình có vòi như vậy thì bánh mới có vòng xoáy chính giữa.

- Khi bánh lấy ra rồi hơi nguội thì lấy cling film đậy lại hay hai chén ụp lên cho nó không bị khô.

Làm nước mắm (theo Thu Ý WTT):

Tôm tươi em luộc với nước thật sôi ( nếu không sôi lắm thì tôm không dai), luộc khoảng 7 phút là tôm chín vớt ra. Chị tắt bếp, rồi để yên cho nồi nước luộc tôm lắng xuống, gạn phần nước trong sang một cái soong khác rồi bắc lên bếp để lửa nhỏ, cho vào vài muỗng đường cát trắng, chút xíu bột ngọt, vẫn để lửa nhỏ cho nước sôi lăn tăn, chị chờ đến khi nước sắc xuống độ khoảng 5 phút là được, rồi cho nước mắm ngon vào, dùng muỗng để lường nước mắm, lúc này chị cho nước mắm vào từng chút một rồi nêm, cho vào rồi nêm... chị cẩn thận chỗ này vì dễ bị mặn lắm.

Còn cách làm tôm chấy, mỡ hành

- Tôm luộc chín vớt ra rổ để ráo, bỏ đầu, bỏ vỏ, cho vào cối giã nhuyễn. Chảo nóng cho dầu ăn vào, khoảng 2 muỗng cafe, rồi cho tôm đã giã vào, dùng vá miết tôm cho bông lên, thấy tôm hơi khô là được, đừng để khô quá không ngon, nhớ cho vào chút xíu bột ngọt ( không cho đường), nhắc tôm xuống cho ra tô hay đĩa vì nếu để trong chảo còn hơi nóng tôm sẽ khô không ngon.

- Mỡ lưng thái hạt lựu, ráng mỡ vàng cho vào tô đã có hành lá thái nhỏ.

- À còn bánh mì nữa chứ, bánh mì sandwich hay baguette xắt hạt lựu rồi bỏ vào chảo dầu đang sôi, chiên cho vàng, vớt ra.

Vậy là xong.

cân lượng thì bác liệu thôi, bác nhé.

1 phần Gan heo xay nhuyễn
2 phần Thịt heo vừa mỡ vừa nạc xay vừa
1 miếng mỡ chài
muối
tiêu
maggi
đường
hành tím xay vừa (nhiều)
tỏi (hơi nhiều)
rượu cognac hay whisky gì cũng được
2 lá thơm
vài hạt tiêu sọ
bơ 10g cho 1 khuôn bánh cao chừng 8-10 cm
khuôn bánh cake

thịt xay xong ướp với muối, tiêu, đường, maggi trong vòng ít nhất 3-4 tiếng. nếu để tủ lạnh thì nhớ cho ra ngoài trước khi bắt đầu các giai đoạn sau.

rửa sạch lá mỡ chài, để ráo, lót khuôn, chừa ra ngoài để phủ lên mặt pâté trước khi nướng.

đốt lò, lửa trên dưới 180°C.

xay hành tím, tỏi, cho vào với chỗ thịt xay đã ướp.

xay gan thật nhuyễn.

trộn đều thịt, hành, tỏi, gan, rượu rồi trút vào khuôn đã có lót mỡ chài. bơ cắt ô, rải đều trên mặt pâté cùng với tiêu sọ, đặt 2 lá thơm lên trên, phủ mặt bằng mỡ chài.

cho khuôn vào lò với khay nước. nướng thấy vàng mặt thì lấy dao rạch xem đủ chín chưa, chín rồi lấy ra ngay, đừng để trong lò mà pâté bị khô, mất ngon.

ăn nguội ngon hơn lúc còn nóng.

pâté này giống pâté de campagne của Pháp hơn là loại pâté "nhão nhão" mà một số nhà bán bánh mì thịt vẫn dùng.
