Ingredients
8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
1/3 cup sugar
2 extra-large egg yolks, at room temperature
2 tablespoons ricotta cheese
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon grated lemon zest (2 lemons)
2 sheets (1 box) frozen puff pastry, defrosted
1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water, for egg wash
Directions
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.

Place the cream cheese and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and cream them together on low speed until smooth. With the mixer still on low, add the egg yolks, ricotta, vanilla, salt, and lemon zest and mix until just combined. Don''t whip!

Unfold 1 sheet of puff pastry onto a lightly floured board and roll it slightly with a floured rolling pin until it''s a 10 by 10-inch square. Cut the sheet into quarters with a sharp knife. Place a heaping tablespoon of cheese filling into the middle of each of the 4 squares. Brush the border of each pastry with egg wash and fold 2 opposite corners to the center, brushing and overlapping the corners of each pastry so they firmly stick together. Brush the top of the pastries with egg wash. Place the pastries on the prepared sheet pan. Repeat with the second sheet of puff pastry and refrigerate the filled Danish for 15 minutes.

Bake the pastries for about 20 minutes, rotating the pan once during baking, until puffed and brown. Serve warm.', "updated_at" = '2011-12-22 18:55:29.051156' WHERE "recipes"."id" = 96

Món này khá tốn thời gian, thích hợp cho cuối tuần không đi ra ngoài. Chuẩn bị xong, chỉ thời gian nằm lò nướng thôi, mất gần 1 tiếng. Đói bụng mà đợi lâu như thế thì chắc ngất xỉu mất. Tuy nhiên, món này chỉ mệt khâu chuẩn bị. Chuẩn bị xong rồi, trong thời gian nướng, ta cứ ngồi đọc sách. Đến lúc cái đồng hồ báo thiết đặt giờ nướng reo ầm ĩ, lấy nó ra. Bữa tối đơn giản nhưng thật ấm cúng và ngon miệng.

Nguyên liệu: (phần 2 người)

4 đùi gà
25 ml nước tương
4 g ngũ vị hương
15 g tỏi (khoảng 6 tép)
5 g đường
1 tí xíu muối
1 củ hành hương
Dầu chiên thường
Dầu olive

1 cup gạo (loại hạt dài) vo sạch, để ráo nước
1 cup sữa tươi
1 cup nước dùng gà
một ít ngò Ý tươi thái nhỏ (hoặc khô)

Chuẩn bị:
1) Đùi gà, để nguyên da, rọc một đường trên thớ thịt để xẻ thịt ra (cho nhanh ngấm gia vị)
2) Pha nước tương, ngũ vị hương, 2/3 tỏi ép nhỏ, đường và tí xíu muối vào một tô lớn.
3) Cho đùi gà vào. Dùng nĩa châm châm vào thịt gà cho gia vị thấm vào thịt theo lỗ châm của nĩa. Ướp thịt khoảng 30 phút, hoặc qua đêm.
Làm nóng lò nướng ở nhiệt độ 350°F (khoảng 180℃)

Cách làm:
1) Bắt chảo lên bếp, cho dầu olive vào. Dầu nóng cho 1/3 tỏi còn lại vào phi tỏi vàng thơm. Cho gạo vào, rang cho gạo ngấm dầu. Chuyển gạo rang vào khay nướng.
2) Bắt một chảo khác lên bếp. Cho dầu vào. Dầu nóng cho hành hương thái nhỏ vào phi cho vàng thơm. Bỏ đùi gà vào, cho mặt da xuống trước, chiên cho đến khi da gà ra hết mỡ, vàng cánh gián, chuyển sang mặt còn lại chiên sơ, xém vàng. Xếp đùi gà vào khay nướng, đặt bên trên gạo rang.
3) Đổ nước dùng gà và sữa tươi vào. Đậy lên trên khay nướng một lớp giấy bạc. Cho vào lò nướng đã làm nóng ở nhiệt độ quy định. Nướng 55 phút hoặc cho đến khi gạo chín, thịt gà mềm.

Đây là một món ăn rất ư bình dân ở Nhật, gọi là onigiri. Các cửa hiệu bán hàng 24/24 giờ đều có bán. Nhân của cơm nắm được cho vào nhiều loại khác nhau: rong biển, cá hồi, cá ngừ khô trộn nước tương,....
Có thể đọc thêm ở đây.

Nguyên liệu: (cho 4 nắm cơm vắt)

Gạo Nhật 1 cup (gạo hạt tròn, loại làm Sushi)
2 miếng rong biển Hàn Quốc loại lớn (nori) (hình phải)
2 gói cá ngừ khô thái mỏng loại 30g/ gói (Katsuobushi) (hình trái)
1 muỗng cà phê nước tương Nhật
Muối

Chuẩn bị:
1) Gạo vo sạch rồi đổ nước đến mức 1 cup, ngâm gạo 30 phút trước khi cắm điện nấu. Có thể tham khảo thêm ở đây.
2) Rong biển cắt làm đôi.
3) Cho một ít xị dầu vào cá ngừ, chỉ vừa đủ ẩm cá ngừ, trộn đều.

Cách làm:1) Cơm chín, bới ra tô để cơm không bị nóng quá.
2) Rửa tay sạch, làm ướt cả hay bàn tay bằng nước lạnh, rưới đều một ít muối lên lòng bàn tay trái. Bới một giá cơm đặt gọn lên lòng bàn tay. Trải cơm bằng ra lòng bàn tay, đặt một chụm cá ngừ khô trộn xị dầu vào ngay vị trí giữa của cơm.
Cho lên trên một ít cơm, đắp lên trên chỗ đặt cá ngừ khô trộn xị dầu.

3) Cách vắt: Đặt bàn tay trái ngang với người, để bàn tay phải lên trên bàn tay trái theo hình chữ thập, chụm bàn tay phải thành hình tam giác và vắt hơi chặt tay. Sau đó trở nắm cơm về phía người sao cho góc tam giác thứ 2 của nắm cơm vắt nằm ngay vị trí góc nhọn của bàn tay phải, vắt hơi chặt tay. Cứ như thế lần lượt trở cơm đến vị trí góc nhọn tam giác và vắt đều tay để tạo thành một nắm cơm vắt hình tam giác.
4) Để 1/2 miếng rong biển lên trên dĩa, đặt cơm vắt ngay giữa miếng rong biển rồi bẻ hai đầu hai bên vào theo cạnh của nắm cơm.

※Món này rất thích hợp khi đi picnic. Nên bọc nilong bên ngoài mỗi nắm cơm khi mang đi để cớm nắm không bị dính vào nhau khó gỡ.', "updated_at" = '2011-12-22 18:55:29.062520' WHERE "recipes"."id" = 99

Nguyên liệu nước chấm:
ớt
tỏi
chanh /dấm
nước dừa tươi/ nước dừa tươi đóng lon/ nước uống (nếu không có nước dừa)
đường
nước mắm ngon

Dụng cụ: nếu có chảo chống dính là tốt nhất, vì sẽ không cần dùng nhiều dầu mà bánh vẫn lóc ra khỏi chảo dễ dàng.

Cách làm:


1) Đậu xanh ngâm nước nóng ấm khoảng 1 tiếng cho bóc vỏ. Đãi vỏ sạch, hấp/luộc chín sao cho đậu vẫn còn nguyên dạng hạt, không bị bể
2) Giá rửa sạch để ráo.
Hành lá rửa sạch cắt nhỏ.
3) Tôm lột vỏ, làm sạch đường chỉ. Ướp tôm thịt với một tí xíu muối, tiêu, tỏi ép nhỏ khoảng nửa tiếng cho ngấm gia vị.
4) Cho bột gạo, bột bắp, muối, bột nghệ và nước soda vào trộn đều. Cho hành lá vào. Bỏ hỗn hợp vào tủ lạnh khoảng nửa tiếng trước khi làm.
5) Chiên bánh:
Chảo nóng, cho một ít dầu vào. Dầu nóng, cho ít lát thịt heo và vài ba con tôm vào xào chín tái, thơm. Dùng vá tròn to( loại múc canh) múc một vá hỗn hợp bột bánh xèo (4) đổ tròn vào chảo. Vừa đổ vừa quay cán chảo cho bột chạy dàn đều một lớp mỏng khắp đáy chảo.
Rắc một ít đậu xanh đều lên bề mặt, cho giá vào phần nửa cái bánh. Đậy nắp lại, đợi khoảng 2~3 phút cho bánh chín vàng. Dùng vá dẹp bẻ gập bánh lại làm đôi. Lấy bánh ra.
Cứ thế lập lại cho đến khi hết bột và tôm thịt rau.

Khi ăn cuốn với rau sà lách hoặc cải cay và rau thơm, chấm với nước mắm pha chua ngọt.
Cho mực vào cũng rất ngon.

Pha nước chấm bánh xèo sao cho có đủ vị ngọt-chua-cay nhưng rất nhạt, nhạt đến độ có thể húp chén mắm như canh vậy (^^). Tham khảo cách pha nước chấm ở đây. Tuy nhiên, phải gia giảm đường-nước và nước mắm sao cho thoả điều kiện trên. Mình thường pha theo tỉ lệ 2 đường-1 mắm-4 nước.
Vị ngọt của chén nước mắm chấm bánh xèo lấy từ nước dừa tươi và đường (nếu không có dừa tươi thì dùng nước dừa tươi đóng lon/ hoặc không nữa thì phải dùng đường thay thế)- chua của chanh hoặc dấm -cay của ớt- thơm của tỏi.
Nếu không có nước dừa thì phải dùng nước uống cũng được nhưng dĩ nhiên là chất lượng sẽ thay đổi :)

Nguyên liệu làm tempura rất đa dạng. Ở đây dùng củ sen và bông cải xanh.

Nguyên liệu: ( 2 người)
củ sen, khoảng 10 cm
1/4 bông cải xanh
1 ít bột mì tây

Bột chiên tempura:
1/2 cái trứng gà
5 muỗng súp bột mì tây
70 ml nước soda (loại nước có ga, không gia vị)

vài tép chanh và muối

Chuẩn bị:
1) Củ sen vọt vỏ, cắt lát tròn mỏng khoảng 1 mm. Ngâm củ sen trong nước có pha một tí dấm để củ sen không bị thâm đen.
2) Bông cải xanh tách nhánh nhỏ vừa miệng ăn.
3) Đánh trứng gà cho tan, cho bột mì tây và nước soda vào khuấy đều. Bỏ vào tủ lạnh khoảng 30 phút trước khi làm.
Cách làm:
1) Bắt chảo lên bếp, cho dầu vào vừa ngập nguyên liệu chiên.
2) Củ sen, bông cải rửa sạch, làm ráo nước. Cho vào tô bột mì tây khô, xóc đều cho bột dính một lớp mỏng. Dũ phần bột thừa cho rớt xuống.
***lớp bột này nhằm mục đích làm cho nguyên liệu dễ dính với hỗn hợp bột chiên.
3) Nhúng rau, củ vào tô hỗn hợp bột chiên tempura ở khâu chuẩn bị (3), có bỏ 1 viên đá giữ hỗn hợp luôn luôn lạnh. Gắp nguyên liệu lên cho bột chảy xuống bớt, chỉ còn một lớp mỏng.
4) Dầu nóng, cho vào chiên 1 mặt xém vàng, chuyển sang mặt còn lại, chiên xém vàng là được. Để lửa vừa khi chiên.

Once all eggs have been added and mixture is smooth, put dough in a piping bag fitted with a number 12 tip. Heat about 1 1/2 inches of oil in a heavy pan. Pipe dough into oil, making a free-form lattice pattern; cook until browned, flipping once. Remove cake from oil, drain on paper towels, and top with powdered sugar. Continue until all of the batter is used.

*1 bag of Alsa baking powder (try to use this brand--commonly found in Asian markets or other single acting baking powder)
*2 tbs tapioca flour
In mixing bowl, add the pork, fish sauce, and sugar and mix. In separate bowl add the water, tapioca flour, and baking powder and mix. It will foam and bubble up--that''s normal. Fold this into the pork mixture. It will be quite moist. Cover and allow to rest at least 6 hrs, but preferably over night in the fridge.

When ready to cook, grind the mixture one more time in small batches in your food processor. The texture should be very smooth--this is the consistency of gio song (stop here if you''re just making gio song for bun moc). You can either wrap it up in banana leaf or in plastic wrap. While it''s prettier and you get a slightly more fragrant cha lua with banana leaf, wrapping the cha lua in plastic wrap is much faster and easier. We made both sausage and round shaped cha lua. Remember the cha lua rises a bit when cook so take that into account when forming your cha lua. Steam for about 20-25 minutes (will vary depending on size). 

*Cooks note: The amount of Alsa baking powder and tapioca starch will determine the cha lua''s "bounciness" and chewiness. Other single acting brands of baking powder should work, although we have never tried.

 1 lb Boneless pork (weight after
 -trimming fat), preferable
 -fresh ham
 3 tb Fish sauce (nuoc mam)
 3 tb Water
 1/2 tb Potato starch or rice flour
 1/2 ts Granulated sugar
 1 t Baking powder
 ds MSG (optional)
 Sprinkling of freshly
 -ground black pepper
 2 oz Pork fat
 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
 
 This recipe is very tasty with an interesting texture.
 Unless you''re a fan of hard work, use a food
 processor. The pate was originally pounded to the
 proper consistency in a mortar and pestle... It can
 be used all sorts of ways++made into balls for soup,
 sliced after cooking and added to lettuce or rice
 paper rolls, served with shrimp chips for
 munchies++whatever inspires you. The cinnamon flavor
 is discernible but not overpowering. I''ve actually
 made this recipe and found it to be a keeper.
 
 Be sure pork is trimmed of all fat. Slice the meat
 1/4 inch thick, then cut into 1 inch squares. Make a
 marinade by combining all the remaining ingredients,
 except for the pork fat and cinnamon, in a large bowl.
 Add the pork slices to the marinade and mix well with
 your hands, then cover the bowl with wrap or foil.
 Refrigerate for 5 hours, and after that period of time
 has elapsed, transfer the bowl to the freezer for 10
 minutes.
 
 Remove the pork from the freezer, add the cinnamon,
 and reduce to a paste in a food processor only.
 
 Boil the pork fat for 10 minutes and dice into small
 pieces, the size of whole peppercorns. Add the diced
 pork fat to the ground pork mixture.
 
 Coat an 8-inch-square baking pan with oil. Put the
 meat paste into the pan and press down firmly with
 your hands, making sure the surface is smooth. The
 meat will come halfway up the side of the pan.
 
 Preheat the oven to 350F and bake the pate for 40
 minutes or until the surface looks brown. Remove from
 the oven and allow to cool. Then slice and serve as
 an appetizer or with French bread for lunch or dinner,
 or use in any recipe where it is required. It can be
 eaten hot or cold.
 
 This will keep fresh in the refrigerator for a week,
 or it can be stored for a longer period in the
 freezer. To reheat, wrap in foil and place in a 300F
 oven for 15 minutes.

You’ll need two small heads of garlic, preferably from a newly harvested crop, and a small bunch of fresh sage leaves — now is a good time to keep a pot growing on your kitchen sill. Cooks differ on how to deal with the garlic. Some just crush whole unpeeled cloves and proceed, then strain the broth later. In my version, the peeled cloves are thickly sliced and the soup is not strained.

Lightly sizzle the garlic in a little olive oil. Give it generous salt and pepper and throw in some fresh sage leaves. Add water and simmer, then ladle over toasted (or not) day-old bread. Insanely good. Crazy.

Then there’s the egg. It adds richness and its flavor marries beautifully with the broth. An egg poached in the broth is an obvious good thing, but so is a whole beaten egg stirred into the pot to form little “rags” just before serving. Or, as they do in the South of France, whisk in just the yolks for a creamier broth. But even eggless, you’ll want two bowls.

Ingredients

1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1/4 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 teaspoon salt
2-1/3 cups all-purpose flour
Directions

This recipe''s Ingredients were scaled to yield a new amount. The directions below still refer to the original recipe yield of 3 loaves.
Add the sugar and yeast to the warm water and let proof.
Stir in 1.5 cups of flour and beat until smooth. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes.
Beat in the salt and then add enough remaining flour to make a stiff dough. Knead until as soft and smooth as a bambino''s behind. Turn in a greased bowl, cover, and let double in size. (I put it in the oven with the light on - perfect rising temperature.)
Once doubled, punch down and divide into three. Place back in the bowl, cover, and let rise.
Once doubled again, punch down and form into three fat "footballs." Grease heavy cookie sheets and sprinkle with corn meal. Place the bread on the sheets, cover with a towel, and let rise.
Once risen, mist with water and place in a preheated 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) oven. Mist loaves with water and turn occasionally while they bake. Bread is done when golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.

Tips:

1) Proof your yeast as directed (mixing water, yeast, & sugar)-- if it doesn''t start bubbling or frothing after 10 min, throw it out. Either the yeast is dead (check expiration date) Or you killed it with HOT tap water > 120 degrees F kills yeast. Optimal temp is LUKE warm around 100F. 

Keep in mind that less handling after rising has started, the better the flavor.

Bring the ingredients together and let sit for 15 minutes before you knead to hydrate and relax. After 15, knead like crazy until smooth like a baby''s bottom. Coat with oil, place in a bowl, cover and let rise until doubled. INSTEAD OF KNEADING THE LIVING TAR OUT OF THE DOUGH, gently but firmly smoosh the dough out, fold in thirds and press with your palm, fold in thirds and press, fold in thirds and press. Form a ball, coat, cover, and let rise again. ', "updated_at" = '2011-12-22 18:55:29.122944' WHERE "recipes"."id" = 111

3 cups lukewarm water
6 1/2 to 7 1/2 cups King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour*
1 tablespoon salt
1 1/2 tablespoons instant yeast

Directions
*The flour/liquid ratio is important in this recipe. If you measure flour by sprinkling it into your measuring cup, then gently sweeping off the excess, use 7 1/2 cups. If you measure flour by dipping your cup into the canister, then sweeping off the excess, use 6 1/2 cups. Most accurate of all, and guaranteed to give you the best results, if you measure flour by weight, use 32 ounces.
1) Combine all of the ingredients in a large mixing bowl, or a large (6-quart), food-safe plastic bucket. For first-timers, "lukewarm" means about 105°F, but don''t stress over getting the temperatures exact here. Comfortably warm is fine; "OUCH, that''s hot!" is not. Yeast is a living thing; treat it nicely.
2) Mix and stir everything together to make a very sticky, rough dough. If you have a stand mixer, beat at medium speed with the beater blade for 30 to 60 seconds. If you don''t have a mixer, just stir-stir-stir with a big spoon or dough whisk till everything is combined.
3) Next, you''re going to let the dough rise. If you''ve made the dough in a plastic bucket, you''re all set — just let it stay there, covering the bucket with a lid or plastic wrap; a shower cap actually works well here. If you''ve made the dough in a bowl that''s not at least 6-quart capacity, transfer it to a large bowl; it''s going to rise a lot. There''s no need to grease the bowl, though you can if you like; it makes it a bit easier to get the dough out when it''s time to bake bread.
4) Cover the bowl or bucket, and let the dough rise at room temperature for 2 hours. Then refrigerate it for at least 2 hours, or for up to about 7 days. (If you''re pressed for time, skip the room-temperature rise, and stick it right into the fridge). The longer you keep it in the fridge, the tangier it''ll get; if you chill it for 7 days, it will taste like sourdough. Over the course of the first day or so, it''ll rise, then fall. That''s OK; that''s what it''s supposed to do.
5) When you''re ready to make bread, sprinkle the top of the dough with flour; this will make it easier to grab a hunk. Grease your hands, and pull off about 1/4 to 1/3 of the dough — a 14-ounce to 19-ounce piece, if you have a scale. It''ll be about the size of a softball, or a large grapefruit.
6) Plop the sticky dough onto a floured work surface, and round it into a ball, or a longer log. Don''t fuss around trying to make it perfect; just do the best you can.
7) Place the dough on a piece of parchment (if you''re going to use a baking stone); or onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Sift a light coating of flour over the top; this will help keep the dough moist as it rests before baking.
8) Let the dough rise for about 45 to 60 minutes. It won''t appear to rise upwards that much; rather, it''ll seem to settle and expand. Preheat your oven (and baking stone, if you''re using one) to 450°F while the dough rests. Place a shallow metal or cast iron pan (not glass, Pyrex, or ceramic) on the lowest oven rack, and have 1 cup of hot water ready to go.
9) When you''re ready to bake, take a sharp knife and slash the bread 2 or 3 times, making a cut about 1/2" deep. The bread may deflate a bit; that''s OK, it''ll pick right up in the hot oven.
10) Place the bread in the oven, and carefully pour the 1 cup hot water into the shallow pan on the rack beneath. It''ll bubble and steam; close the oven door quickly.
11) Bake the bread for 25 to 35 minutes, until it''s a deep, golden brown.
12) Remove the bread from the oven, and cool it on a rack. Store leftover bread in a plastic bag at room temperature.
13) Yield: 3 or 4 loaves, depending on size.', "updated_at" = '2011-12-22 18:55:29.127504' WHERE "recipes"."id" = 112

1/4 cup and 2 tablespoons cold water
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3-1/2 egg whites
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
Directions

This recipe''s Ingredients were scaled to yield a new amount. The directions below still refer to the original recipe yield of 1 tube cake.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Wash a 10 inch angel food tube pan in hot soapy water to ensure it is totally grease free.
Measure flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into sifter. Sift into bowl. Make a well; add oil, egg yolks, water, vanilla to the well in the order that is given. Set aside. Don''t beat.
In a large mixing bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar until very stiff. Set aside.
Using same beaters, beat egg yolk batter until smooth and light. Pour gradually over egg whites, folding in with rubber spatula. Do not stir. Pour batter into angel food tube pan.
Bake for 55 minutes. Increase heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake 10 to 15 minutes until done. Invert pan until cool.

Tips:

Also, when beating the whites, the highest speed to be used should be medium. 2) Mixing the yolk mixture first may be more beneficial if you tend to be a slow mixer. If the stiffened egg whites sit too long, they begin to "melt" or "re-liquify". 3)When folding the two mixtures together, be sure there are no lumps or streaks. This may sound obvious, but for newbies like me this is important to know. 4) Last but not least, if you''re baking in two round pans rather than a big tube pan, watch the cakes carefully as they cook. They are guaranteed to burn or fail if they''re in the oven for 55 minutes. I timed the cakes for 20 minutes and checked every ten minutes after that. I think it was a total of 40 minutes to create perfection. ^-^

Time: About 1½ hours plus 14 to 20 hours’ rising

3 cups all-purpose or bread flour, more for dusting
¼ teaspoon instant yeast
1¼ teaspoons salt
Cornmeal or wheat bran as needed.

1. In a large bowl combine flour, yeast and salt. Add 1 5/8 cups water, and stir until blended; dough will be shaggy and sticky. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably about 18, at warm room temperature, about 70 degrees.

2. Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a work surface and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest about 15 minutes.

3. Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or to your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball. Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with flour, wheat bran or cornmeal; put dough seam side down on towel and dust with more flour, bran or cornmeal. Cover with another cotton towel and let rise for about 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.

4. At least a half-hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 450 degrees. Put a 6- to 8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as it heats. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand under towel and turn dough over into pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess, but that is O.K. Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes. Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes, then remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.

Yield: One 1½-pound loaf.

Thực hiện:

Bật sẵn lò ở 210ºC. 
 
Lót giấy bạc lên khay nướng.
 
Rắc tiêu, muối đều lên cánh gà rồi xếp chúng lên khay nướng đã lót giấy bạc, cho vào lò và nướng. 
 
Tỏi bóc vỏ, bằm nhỏ. Lá hẹ rửa sạch, xắt nhỏ. 
 
Trộn tỏi bằm với các nguyên liệu còn lại trong công thức (trừ gà và lá hẹ), khuấy đều cho đường tan hết.
Sau khoảng 40 phút nướng cánh gà sẽ có màu vàng nâu sậm và giòn. Bạn có thể tăng hoặc giảm thời gian nướng tùy theo việc bạn muốn ăn gà giòn tới đâu.
 
Rưới đều nước trộn ở bước 3 lên gà đã nướng, đảo đều cho gà thấm nước trộn rồi lấy ra đĩa, rắc lá hẹ lên đĩa cánh gà là xong.

Với cách làm này bạn tiết kiệm được thời gian ướp gà, mà khi nướng gà trong lò bạn có thể nấu các món khác trong bữa cơm, lúc nấu xong cũng là lúc gà chín, rất tiện.
 
Nếu không có lò nướng bạn có thể chiên gà cũng được; tuy nhiên sau khi chiên gà thì bạn nên cho ra đĩa có lót sẵn giấy thấm dầu để thấm bớt dầu mỡ, ăn cho đỡ ngán mà cũng có lợi cho sức khỏe hơn.

Our shell on shrimps where already de-veined. If you can''t find them already de-veined, lay shrimp flat on cutting board and cut shallow along the spine of the shrimp with a sharp knife and de-vein. In mixing bowl, combine oil, lemongrass, Sriracha, salt, garlic and shrimp. Allow to marinade in the fridge for about 1 hr.

Skewer the length of the shrimp by inserting it in the tail and out through the head, straightening the curve of shrimp out. We think this makes for a nicer presentation and easier grilling.

Grill until meat becomes opaque, about 4-6 minutes. We love the citrus flavors of fresh coriander so garnish with finely chopped ngo om (rice paddy herb-substitute cilantro if not available). For the dip, squeeze a wedge of lime with Sriracha and top with finely chopped coriander.

In a mixing bowl, combine banh xeo mix, coconut milk, and beer and mix well. Let the ingredients meld together for about 20 minutes and add green onions. Marinate the pork with salt, pepper, sugar, and fish sauce and set aside. Season shrimp with touch of salt and pepper and set aside.

Before starting to pour your crepes, make sure you have have plenty of counter space and line up all your ingredients ready to go--largest nonstick pan you have, a ladle and flexible spatula, batter, pork, shrimp, onions, and small bowl of cooking oil.
On high heat, heat 1 teaspoon of cooking oil in a nonstick frying pan and sautee a few pieces of pork--when it''s about 1/3rd of of the way done, add onion slices and shrimps since they are quicker to cook. Distribute the shrimps and pork evenly prior to adding the batter. Don''t use too much filling--you don''t want to overload the crepes.

Stir batter with ladle and add about 3/4 quarter ladle full into the center of the pan and quickly swirl the pan to evenly distribute a thin layer batter to the very edges of the pan. Try to go for as thin a layer as possible. You may have to adjust how much batter you use depending on how big your pan is.

Place a lid over for about 1.5 minutes or so. When you check the crepe notice that the area of uncooked batter in the center will get smaller and smaller (see above). When the crepe is almost completely cooked, the edges of the crepe start to curl up a bit and turn golden brown. Now take another small amount of cooking oil in a spoon distribute oil around the edges so the crepe gets crispy, won''t burn, and will be easier to flip.

Now add the pre-steamed beansprouts to one side of the crepe. Turn the heat down to medium heat and place the lid over for another 1 minute or until gold brown. Using the flexible spatula carefully flip over the other half. When golden and nicely browned, don''t try to lift the crepe out of the pan with a spatula....just tilt the pan and slide the crepe over to a plate and serve immediately. When pouring the next crepe, add more oil as needed.

Enjoy with plenty of lettuce, mints, basil, and perilla.

1 bell pepper, finely diced
1 bunch of fresh basil, chiffonade thinly
muffin pan

Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees. Using a mold cutter or a small bowl, cut out some circular pieces of bread and using rolling pin or your hands, flatten the bread. Spread some butter or olive oil on both sides of bread, including the edges, and fit into the muffin tin that is also very lightly greased with butter or oil. Place in middle rack for about 10-12 minutes or until nicely brown and toasty.

Combine the cut shrimp and whole shrimp with 1 tbs of fish sauce, 1/2 tbs sugar, 1 ts pepper, 1/2 ts Sriracha, 1/2 garlic and shallots and mix and set aside. In separate bowl, combine the cut pork belly with 1 tbs fish sauce, 1/2 ts thick soy sauce, 1/2 tbs sugar, 1 ts pepper and remainder of garlic and shallots and mix well.

Heat a pan to medium high and sautee the pork belly. No cooking oil needed as the fat from the pork belly will render and brown. After about 3-4 min add only the cut shrimp and cook till opaque. Finally add the diced bell peppers, toss, and turn off heat and transfer to bowl. Using the same pan, add a touch of cooking oil and sear the butterflied shrimps.

By this time, the bread cups should be nice and toasty. These should slide out easily, if not, give it a gentle twist and it''ll slide out and transfer to serving plate. Add the shrimp and pork mixture to each bread cup. Top with a butterflied shrimp and garnish with fresh basil. Use additional Sriricha sauce for an extra kick.

Cooks note: To butterfly shrimp, cut down the back like deveining but deeper, being careful not to cut through the shrimp. On the underside of the shrimp, there is a blue vein, pierce through that vein at a few places to prevent the butterflied shrimp from curling up too much. We prefer leaving the tail on.

directions:
In large mixing bowl, combine the beef shank with the spice marinade for at least 2 hours.

Saute the beef with 1 tbs of annato seed oil until browned and seared under medium high heat. Transfer this into the slow cooker. Add the beef tendons, stalk of lemonsgrass, star anise seeds, bay leaves, and beef broth. You may need to add more broth or water to just cover and submerge the beef.

Set slow cooker to lowest possible setting and allow to cook covered for overnight or about 8 hours. About 1 hour before it''s done, add the carrots. Just before serving add another 1 tbs of annato seed oil to the broth for a great red color. Make final adjustment and season to taste.

Cooks Notes:
You can also boil the tendon separately ahead of time on constant high boil for about 2 hours or until tender, then cut and add to the bo kho just before it''s done.

If you don''t have a slow cooker, simmer in big covered pot until beef is tender about 4 hrs.

To make annatto seed oil, heat 2 tbs of olive with 1/2 of annato seeds. The oil will be steeped with a red color. Do not allow oil to boil, when the color is steeped red, turn of heat and drain the seeds.

10 medium sized fried tofu (halved)
1 tbs of annato seed oil mixture (optional--see this post)
1 packet of vermicelli noodles
Soak dried shrimps until softened, roughly about 1hr, and then mince finely. A small food chopper will work nicely here.

Cook the vermicelli noodles and set aside. At the same time add pork or chicken stock into large pot and bring to boil.

In the meantime, make the crab mixture. Combine ground pork, crab, can of crab meat in spices, shallots, fine shrimp paste, fish sauce, coarsely chopped dried shrimps, pepper, and sugar. Add the beaten eggs and mix well. When the stock comes to a boil, slowly add this crab mixture into stock. Now add the tomatoes and tofu and bring to boil again. Finally, season stock with additional salt or fish sauce. Finish with an optional tablespoon of annato seed oil for nice distinctive reddish color.

To make the split rau muong, there''s a very very high tech process...in the form of a $2 utensil you see above. It''s composed of a thin rod and at the end, a sharp turbine like cutting edge. Pluck the leaves of the rau muong and insert the long metal rod into the stem opening. With one hand hold the device at the top and with the other, grab the stem and with a quick fluid motion, push the stem through the blade opening. These special devices are often sold at the Asian markets and are so handy in making perfectly split rau moung stems which gives bun rieu a refreshing crunch.

3 tablespoons roasted peanuts, coarsely chopped
4 tablespoons of scallion oil (heat 4 tablespoons of olive oil, remove from heat and add finely chopped scallions)
In a large bowl, combine meat with garlic, shallots, lemongrass, curry, fish sauce, sugar, pepper and salt and mix well and set aside in fridge and prepare leaves.


 

To prepare the leaves, detach the leaves from their stems and roll with glossy side facing down. Place a generous 1 tablespoon full of meat near the base of the leave and shape accordingly. Roll the base over making sure that the length of the meat doesn’t exceed the width of the leaf. Secure the apex of the leaf with a tiny bit of meat mixture, using it as a paste. Use a scissor to cut of any excess ends of betel leaf.
 


There are multiple options when cooking bo la lot. In Vietnam, these are grilled over small charcoal ovens, but you have multiple great options. You can grill using skewers or a grilling basket or broil in the oven for about 6-8 minutes, turning a few times to prevent the leaves from burning.

You can also just sautee these with a bit of oil in a pan, or what we did was sauteed it about 2 minutes to keep the meat moist and then quickly seared it on the grill to char the leaves. Flip once to prevent the leaves from burning.


Top with dry roasted peanuts and scallion oil and serve immediately. We served ours with bun thit nuong, and cha gio (egg rolls).

Peel and cut the sweet potatoes into thin french fry slices and set aside. Prep the shrimp and set aside.

Shape the well coated sweet potatoes into a platform for the shrimp, about 4-5 pieces and place in frying pan, making sure they stay close together and not spread apart. Immediately coat a shrimp with a little batter and place on top of the sweet potatoes, pressing it firmly down and holding it there for a few seconds with some tongs. The shrimp will stick onto the sweet potatoes, but you might want to spoon over some hot oil the shrimp to cook the batter sealing the shrimp on.

Chicken from above
Thinly fried egg
Cha Lua (found in most Vietnamese/Asian markets wrapped in banana leaf)
Scramble about 3 eggs in a bowl and using the largest nonstick skillet you have, pan fry a thin layer of egg until slightly golden brown. Remove from heat and set aside. When cooled, slice thinnly about 3 inches in length. We prefer as thin a layer of egg as possible.

When the chicken cools, hand shred the meat, removing any excess fat and skin.

Cha Lua is a classic Vietnamese ham/sausage made from lean pork. Slice thinnly, matchstick size.

Boil quail eggs for about 8-10 minutes and set aside to cool in water bath. Peel the quail eggs under running water, starting with the fat end. Unlike chicken eggs, you have to be more gentle and be careful not to break these delicate eggs.

In another separate bowl, lightly beaten the eggs and set aside.

Now add the thickening mixture a tablespoon at a time allowing a few minutes in between to allow the soup to thicken.

directions:
In large stock pot, add roasted onion, ginger, dried squid, and chicken bones and enough water to cover the ingredients and add 1 tbs salt and sugar. Bring to slow boil and be diligent in skimming the gunk and scum from the broth. When you have removed most of the gunk, add the chicken and keep the stock at a slow simmer and cook chicken for about 35 minutes. Remove chicken and let cool, but covered in plastic wrap. Remove and discard chicken bones. Season the stock with more salt and sugar as needed.

When cooled, break down the chicken by shredding the breast and meat of the hindquarters into thin strips. The meat should really just almost fall off the bone without much effort. Using butcher''s knife, chop the drumsticks and wings. Set the shredded chicken aside.

Prepare your egg noodles by unraveling the pre-portioned bundle of noodles. Bring a large pot of water to boil and in large colander, dip a bundle for 10 seconds, remove and rinse in cold water. You want these noodles to be al dente. Drain and transfer to serving bowl. Drizzle the noodles with some pure sesame oil.

Cách Làm:

Mứt chuối thái hạt lựu lạc rang giã giập, hạt sen luộc chín (nhưng phải còn nguyên hạt, không bị vỡ nát), đỗ đỏ ngâm nở, luộc chín (nếu có tro bếp, lọc lấy 1 thìa nước tro, chế vào nồi nước luộc đậu đỏ thì sẽ chóng nhừ), dừa già gọt sạch phần ngoài cùng có màu nâu giữ lại phần cùi màu trắng. Lấy một phần dừa già thái hạt lựu. Dùng nước sôi nhồi bột sắn lọc cho dẻo rồi bọc ra ngoài các miếng dừa hạt lựu, viên tròn lại thả vào nồi nước sôi để luộc. Khi bột nổi lên, vớt ra thả ngay vào nồi nước đun sôi để nguội, ngâm vài phút rồi vớt ra để riêng. Phần dừa còn lại cho vào máy xay cua xay nhuyễn hoặc nạo thành sợi nhỏ, chế nước sôi vào bóp lấy nước cốt. Lọc thêm 2 lần nước, thu được nước dừa loãng hơn nước cốt lần đầu. Thạch đen thái hạt lựu. 

Đỗ xanh mua loại đã xay nhưng còn sống, tự ngâm và đãi sạch vỏ thì sau ăn chè sẽ thấy thơm hơn loại đỗ xanh đã đãi vỏ, sấy khô. Cho đỗ xanh đã đãi sạch vỏ vào nồi nước lã, đun sôi đến chín nhừ (hớt bỏ bọt). Dùng đũa cả đánh tơi. Lấy nước luộc hạt sen và nước dừa (lọc lần 2 và lần 3) chế vào nồi đậu xanh cho đủ 29 cốc. Cho đường (gia giảm đường tùy khẩu vị). Bào hoặc đập nhỏ đá cho vào 1/3 cốc, cho mứt chuối, đỗ đỏ, hạt sen, mứt quả sê ri, lạc rang, táo tàu (mỗi cốc từ 1 đến 2 quả tùy lượng táo bạn có), thạch đen, hạt trân châu và viên bột bọc dừa vào từng cốc.

1 cup of very concentrated fresh beet juice or 2-3 drops of red food coloring
3/4 cup of tapioca starch
1 1/2 cups coconut milk
About 1/4 cup of fresh jasmine flowers (or 1/2 teaspoon of jasmine or rose extract)
Sugar to taste
A tiny pinch of salt
Prepare the coconut cream by adding just enough sugar to the coconut milk and keep tasting until the mixture is sweet enough for you. The coconut milk is supposed to be on the sweet side as the mock pomegranate seeds are pretty bland. Also, keep in mind that the ice will dilute the coconut milk somewhat once the dessert is assembled.
Add a tiny pinch of salt to round out the flavor.
Heat up the coconut milk mixture briefly just to allow the sugar to dissolve; there''s no need to heat it beyond that point. Bring the pot off the heat and let the mixture cool slightly.
If using fresh jasmine flowers, add them to the coconut milk and let it steep for an hour or so. If using jasmine or rose extract, just add it to the coconut milk and you''re done; no steeping is needed.
Soak your water chestnut or jicama dice in the beet juice for 5 minutes. You can also tint them with red food coloring.
Toss the chestnut dice into a bowl of tapioca starch and make sure each and every piece is coated on all sides.
Shake excess starch off of the water chestnut pieces; set aside.
Put some cold water in a bowl and place it close to the stove.
Bring a pot of water (about 3 quarts) of to a boil. Drop the flour-coated water chestnuts into the boiling water, one by one (to prevent them from clumping up).
Once the mock pomegranate seeds float to the surface of the water, transfer them from the pot with a slotted spoon into the cold water bowl where they should remain until the dessert is ready to serve.
To serve, split the drained mock pomegranate seeds between two dessert bowls and pour half of the coconut cream over them. Top it off with crushed or shaved ice and serve immediately.

Start by preparing the pan. Use a 4-cup pan, like a high-sided (with a 2" wall) 8-inch round or square, or an 11" x 17" sponge sheet. To prepare the pan, smear a bit of softened butter to lightly coat the bottom and side. Line the bottom with parchment paper. Smear the parchment paper with a bit more butter. Add ¼ to ½ cup all-purpose flour (depending on the size of the pan) and shake and turn the pan around to coat it. Standing over the sink, invert and tap the pan to remove excess flour. Set aside.

Now put a rack in the lower third position and preheat to 350F. Then, have your mixer (or whisk) and rubber spatula handy. Finally, gather the ingredients and organize yourself so you can move swiftly and smoothly through the process.

For egg yolk batter base:
3 large egg yolks, placed in a metal bowls, about 3-quart capacity
½ cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

For egg whites:
3 large egg whites, place in a metal bowl, 2-3-quart capacity
Pinch of salt, non-iodized table salt, preferred
Scant ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar 
1 1/2 tablespoons sugar

For finishing the batter:
1/3 cup plus ¼ cup cake flour (such as Swans Down brand) scooped and leveled into a sifter set over a piece of parchment or plate (measure 1/3 cup then measure 1/4 cup for 7/12 cup total!)
3 tablespoons tepid melted, unsalted butter (keep cooled butter on stove to avoid solidification)

1. Start beating the egg yolks in the bowl. Gradually sprinkle in the sugar by the tablespoon to incorporate well. (Do this too fast and the batter will be grainy with sugar.) Continue beating for several minutes, until the mixture is thick, pale yellow, and when you pause and lift the whisk (or beaters), the batter drips down and forms a ribbon that slowly dissolves on the surface. Now, beat in the vanilla. Set aside.

2. Wash and dry the whisk (or beaters) well.

3. Start beating the egg whites. When they are foamy throughout, sprinkle in the salt and cream of tartar. Continue beating until soft peaks form (when the whisk (or beaters) is lifted out of the egg whites, a soft, slightly bent over peak of egg white forms in the bowl). As you beat, the whites will have gone from clear to light grey to solid white. Instead of sliding from the walls of the bowl, they will stick to the bowl.

After soft peaks form, sprinkle in the 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar and continue beating for a couple more minutes to generate stiff egg whites (the peak stands straight when the whisk is lifted from the bowl). The whites will have a sheen.

4. Immediately take a large rubber spatula and plop a ¼ of the egg whites into the egg yolk base. Stir gently to lighten the base. Then plop 1/3 of the remaining whites onto the base. Sift ¼ of the flour on top. Delicately and quickly use the spatula to fold the ingredients together, until they are nearly all incorporated. (To fold, plunge the spatula sideways - like a knife - into the center of the batter, touching bottom. Rapidly bring the spatula to the wall of the bowl and rotate it to scoop up and fold the batter over the whites and flour. Do this several times.)

Repeat with another 1/3 of the remaining whites and 1/3 of the remaining flour. Fold again until almost blended.

Fold in ½ of the remaining whites, ½ of the remaining flour. Fold again until almost blended. Fold in the remaining whites and remaining flour. Fold again until nearly blended. At that point, pour in the melted butter in a circle. Quickly fold it into the batter (do not overblend or the batter will deflate). The finished batter will be pale yellow, very thick, and light feeling.

5. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. It should fill to about ¼ inch of the rim. Scoop out extra batter to avoid overflow during baking.

6. Use the spatula to spread the batter out evenly in the pan. Tilt the pan in all direction to slightly push the batter toward the rim. This prevents a domed-center during baking.

7. Gently slide the cake into the oven. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. The cake will rise slowly and then brown. The cake is done when its puff sinks slightly and the sides show a faint line of shrinkage from the edges of the pan.

8. Remove the cake from the oven and cool on a rack for 15 minutes. (It will deflate and pull away from the pan walls.) Run a knife all around the edge, between the cake and the pan. Invert the cake onto your hand (or back on the rack), give the cake bottom a tap, and then remove the cake pan. Peel off the parchment paper and discard. Invert the cake, top side up, onto the rack. Allow to cool completely (about 1 hour) before eating, filling, or icing.

Notes and Variations

When baking the cake in advance, slip it into a zip-top bag after it has cooled. Refrigerate it for 2 to 3 days or freeze it for several weeks.
Finely grated citrus zest may be added to the egg yolk base. Substitute it for the vanilla or work it in along with the vanilla. About 1 1/2 teaspoons will do.
You may omit the melted butter, if you like a lighter, more spongy, chewier result.
Sift some ground spice or cocoa powder in with the cake flour for flavor variation.

Ingredients

4-5 large onions, about 4 pounds, red and/or sweet
2-4 sprigs fresh thyme
3-5 bay leaves (oops, forgot them in the photo)
3-5 cloves garlic, minced
kosher salt
fresh ground black pepper
flour, about 1/4 cup (see note below)
1-2 cups wine
8 ounces beef broth

Directions
I decided to make this because I had a container of beef broth in the freezer. I had kept the drippings from the Christmas rib roast, the pot roast, every time I cooked beef for a month it went into the freezer. You can do it with canned beef broth, but try to find one with as few additives as possible.

Start by prepping the onions. Cut off both ends and cut them in half.

 

Peel the outer layer, then cut into thin strips.

 

Melt a few tablespoons of butter or fat (I’m using bacon fat) in a dutch oven over medium heat.



Add the onion, minced garlic, bay leaves and thyme and set heat to medium-low.

 
 

Cook until the onions start to turn translucent without mixing them.



Oops, forgot to add salt and pepper.

 

Turn the onions a few times to make sure everything gets some time on the bottom to caramelize. Don’t worry too much about burning the onions. All that burned on goodness is going to be pure flavor. That’s what the wine is for. Use it to scrape up everything off the bottom, then cook the onions for several minutes, stirring frequently, until most of the wine is cooked off.

 

Some people insist it has to be white. Some insist it has to be red. Since I’m not a wine drinker, I don’t really have a preference. So I used the bottle that was open.

The thyme and bay leaves should have given up all their flavor by now, so go ahead and fish them out.



Add a little flour to the onions and cook for about 5-10 minutes, until the dry flour taste is cooked out.



Start with just enough flour to just coat the onions lightly, only a couple of tablespoons. Hold the rest in reserve until you add the broth and see if it has thickened enough, or if it needs more.

Now add the beef broth. Since mine was very concentrated, I did four ounces of broth and four ounces of water.

 

Simmer for another 20 minutes to a half-hour to reduce the liquid and concentrate the flavor. Ladle into oven safe bowls and add croutons to the top.



The croutons are to keep the cheese from sinking. Lots of recipes call for gruyere, which is crazy expensive. I like a slice of swiss and a slice of provolone.



Put the baking sheet with the bowls on it under the broiler for a couple of minutes* until the cheese is bubbling and starting to brown on the edges.



* NOTE: When I said “a couple of minutes” I forgot that not everyone has used the broiler before. MissFoxxy left hers in a little too long and discovered you can set cheese on fire. Don’t walk away from it, and check frequently.

Be careful, the cheese will hold the heat in really well, so it’s going to stay hot until you dig in.', "updated_at" = '2011-12-22 18:55:29.249085' WHERE "recipes"."id" = 149

Cách làm:

1. Chuẩn bị khuôn: Dùng khuôn tròn hoặc chữ nhật, đường kính 20-22cm, cao 8-10cm. Lấy miếng bơ lạnh thoa đều khắp lòng khuôn.


Rắc bột vào khuôn. Nghiêng cho đều khắp. Đổ bỏ bột thừa.

Trứng và đường đánh chung. Sử dụng máy đánh trứng để bàn (Stand Mixer) hoặc máy đánh trứng cầm tay (Hand Mixer), khoảng 4′ sẽ đuợc hỗn hợp như ý nếu dùng Stand mixer, còn nếu dùng Hand mixer thì sẽ mất thời gian khoảng 10'' (tốc độ cao nhất của máy đánh trứng).


Nguyên lý tạo nở của bánh là do bọt khí có trong hỗn hợp. Nếu theo dõi, mọi người sẽ thấy ở 1 phút đầu tiên, bong bóng trong hỗn hợp lớn, và trong suốt. Càng về sau, bọt khí có đường kính đều nhau hơn, bắt đầu nhỏ dần lại. Ở phút thứ 3, khi nhấc que đánh bột lên, hỗn hợp sẽ chảy nhanh xuống, cho muối vào . Đánh tiếp một thời gian nữa bọt sẽ nhỏ hơn, và cứng hơn, khi chảy xuống tạo hình chóp.

6. Trong lúc đánh trứng, vặn lò 170 độ C, thời gian để 55 phút


7. Hỗn hợp sau khi đánh bông


8. Rây từ từ bột vào tô trộn. Dùng phới trộn để trộn nhẹ nhàng, dứt khoát.




9. Đổ hỗn hợp vào khuôn


10. Dàn đều bề mặt


11. Cho vào lò. Lúc này lò đã được làm nóng trong 10'', thời gian còn lại là 45''


Sau 10'', bánh đã nở cao dần


Sau nữa...

Lưu ý: Mỗi loại lò nhiệt độ có thể khác nhau. Thời gian nướng và nhiệt độ cũng có thể thay đổi. Sau khi làm lần đầu tiên là có thể biết được lò nhà mình nhiệt độ cao hay thấp so với nhiệt độ chuẩn. Từ đó có thể gia giảm. Sau 20'' nướng, nếu mặt bánh đã có màu vàng nâu gần như đạt yêu cầu thì mình có thể giảm nhiệt độ xuống còn 165 cũng được, để cho bánh chín từ từ và tiếp tục nở cao. Thông thường nướng 1 chiếc bánh dùng 1 công thức với khuôn như trên thì sẽ hết khoảng 35-40''.

Eggs benedict is also great made with slices of smoked salmon in place of the bacon. If you are in or around New Jersey, try it with Taylor ham.
INGREDIENTS
8 pieces of bacon or 4 pieces of Canadian bacon
2 tablespoons chopped parsley, for garnish
4 eggs
2 teaspoons white or rice vinegar
2 English muffins
Butter
Blender Hollandaise
10 Tbsp unsalted butter
3 egg yolks
1 Tbsp lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon salt
Dash of cayenne or tabasco
METHOD
1 Start with the bacon. Heat a large skillet on medium low heat. Add the strips of bacon or the slices of Canadian bacon. Slowly fry, turning occasionally, until the bacon is browned on both sides, and if using strip bacon, much of the fat is rendered out (about 10 minutes). Use tongs or a fork to remove the bacon from the pan, set on a paper towel to absorb the excess fat. Don''t pour the bacon fat left in the pan down the drain! Either sop it up with paper towels when it has cooled a bit, or pour it into a jar to be used later (see rendering bacon fat).
2 While the bacon is cooking, bring a larage saucepan two-thirds-filled with water to a boil, then add the vinegar. Bring the water to a boil again, then lower the heat to a bare simmer.
3 Make the blender hollandaise. To make blender hollandaise, melt 10 Tbsp unsalted butter. Put 3 egg yolks, a tablespoon of lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender, blend on medium to medium high speed for 20-30 seconds, until eggs lighten in color. Turn blender down to lowest setting, slowly dribble in the hot melted butter, while continuing to blend. Taste for salt and acidity and add more salt or lemon juice to taste.Transfer it to a container you can use for pouring and set it on a warm – but not hot – place on or near the stovetop.
4 Poach the eggs. Here is an easy method for poaching eggs. Essentially, working one egg at a time you crack an egg into a small bowl and slip it into the barely simmering water. Once it begins to solidify, you can slip in another egg, until you have all four cooking. Turn off the heat, cover the pan, and let sit for 4 minutes. (Remember which egg went in first, you''ll want to take it out first.) When it comes time to remove the eggs, gently lift out with a slotted spoon. Note that the timing is a little variable on the eggs, depending on the size of your pan, how much water, how many eggs, and how runny you like them. You might have to experiment a little with your set-up to figure out what you need to do to get the eggs exactly the way you like them.
5 As soon as all the eggs are in the poaching water, begin toasting your English muffins. If you can’t get all the muffins toasted by the time the eggs are ready, gently remove the eggs from the poaching water and set in a bowl.
6 To assemble the eggs benedict, butter one side of an English muffin. Top with two slices of bacon or 1 slice of Canadian bacon. You can trim the bacon to fit the muffin if you’d like. Put a poached egg on top of the bacon, then pour some hollandaise over. Sprinkle some parsley over it all and serve at once.

INGREDIENTS
Fresh eggs
1 to 2 teaspoons vinegar (rice vinegar works well) (optional)
Equipment needed
Shallow saucepan with cover
Slotted spoon
METHOD
1 First bring water in a saucepan to almost boiling. If the water is already boiling, lower the heat until it is no longer boiling. At this point, you can add one or two teaspoons of vinegar to the water, if you want. The vinegar will help the egg whites to congeal more easily. We use seasoned rice vinegar.
2 Working with the eggs one by one, crack an egg into a small cup, then place the cup near the surface of the hot water and gently drop the egg into the water. With a spoon, nudge the eggwhites closer to their yolks. This will help the egg whites hold together.
3 Turn off the heat. Cover. Let sit for 4 minutes, until the egg whites are cooked.
4 Lift eggs out of pan with a slotted spoon.
One trick to make the eggs stay somewhat contained is to take a ring from a mason jar and place it in the pan. Drop the egg over the mason jar ring and let it settle in the ring, then turn off the heat and cover.
Alternatively, the truly easiest way to make poached eggs is with an egg poacher.
Remove the cups you plan to use. Fill the bottom of the pan with 1/2 an inch of water. Bring to a boil. Crack an egg into one of the stick-free egg cups. Place in the cup holder in the pan. Cover. Wait 3-4 minutes and remove from heat. Lift up the handle of the egg cup and slide the poached egg out onto a plate. Sometimes we add a little dab of butter to the bottom of the egg cup before putting the raw egg into it to make it easier for the egg to slide out.

Method
Mix all the ingredients together in a non-reactive bowl and set aside to marinate for anywhere from 1 hour to overnight. Drain and discard any excess marinade.
To Broil: Heat an oven broiler to high. Spread the meat evenly in a single layer on an ovenproof pan. Set 4-6 inches under the broiler flame and broil until cooked through, 5-8 minutes. Stir halfway through to cook evenly.
To Grill: Heat coals or set gas to high heat. Spread the meat in a grill basket and grill until cooked through, 5-8 minutes, turning occasionally.
Serve inside folded pita bread with your choice of garnishes (see variations).
Variations
Condiments and Garnishes: Shawarma is commonly served with tahini (taratour) sauce, yogurt sauce or garlic mayonnaise. Other garnishes include chopped tomatoes, sliced cucumbers, shredded lettuce, sliced red onion, pickles, mango pickle, hummus or even French fries.
Gyros (Greece): Serve with tzatziki sauce.
Döner Kebab (Turkey): Serve with cacik sauce (see tzatziki variations).
Lavash bread can be used instead of pita. Roll all of the ingredients up in a piece of lavash like a burrito to make a Middle Eastern wrap.
Shawarma is sometimes made with a mixture of meats. There is even turkey shawarma. Goat meat shawarma is popular in Saudi Arabia.
Vary the number and amount of spices to your own taste. Some recipes call for cinnamon to be added to the mix.

1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon butter
2 tablespoons sour cream
DIRECTIONS:
You have scaled this recipe''s ingredients to yield a new amount (2). The directions below still refer to the original recipe yield (3).
1.	Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned but still soft. Reserve the bacon grease in the skillet, and cool the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Once cool, mix the bacon together with the feta cheese, 3 tablespoons of sour cream, oregano, and black pepper in a small bowl; set aside.
2.	Lay a chicken breast flat onto your work surface. Use the tip of a sharp boning or paring knife to cut a 2-inch pocket in the chicken breast. Repeat with the remaining chicken breasts. Spoon the bacon mixture into the pockets. Pour the flour, egg, and bread crumbs into separate, shallow dishes. Gently press the chicken breasts into the flour to coat. Dip each into the beaten egg, then press into bread crumbs.
3.	Reheat the bacon grease over medium heat. Brown the chicken breasts on both sides in the hot fat, about 2 minutes per side. Reserve the bacon grease in the pan. Place the breasts on a baking dish, and bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink and the filling is hot, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
4.	Meanwhile, place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.
5.	While the potatoes are boiling, cook the onion in the remaining bacon grease over medium heat until very tender and golden brown, about 10 minutes. Once the potatoes are done, mash together with the onion, butter, and remaining 3 tablespoons of sour cream.

2 cups cold milk
2 (3.4 ounce) packages cheesecake flavor instant pudding and pie filling
2 cups whipped topping
Directions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 baking dish.
Combine the cake mix, vanilla pudding mix, water, oil, eggs, and pie spice in a large mixing bowl; pour into the prepared dish.
Bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature on a wire rack. Cut the cake into 1-inch cubes.
Whisk together the milk and cheesecake pudding mix. Allow to set, about 2 minutes. 

Mix pumpkin into the pudding mixture.

Layer 1/3 of the cake cubes into the bottom of a large bowl; top with 1/3 of the cream mixture and 1/3 whipped topping. Repeat layering until all ingredients are uses. Refrigerate 1 hour before serving.

2 ½ cups milk (I used a mix of skim and 2%)
50g salted butter
1 vanilla bean (or alternatively, 2-3 tsp of vanilla extract)
3 large eggs + 3 large egg yolks
300g granulated sugar
1 tsp sea salt (a little less if using table salt)
150g all purpose flour
6 tbsp rum

Combine the milk and butter in a pot. Cut the vanilla bean in half and scrape the seeds into the pot. Throw in the remainder of the bean as well. Cook over medium heat and bring to a boil. As soon as the milk starts to bubble and foam, turn off the heat and let the mixture cool. (Note: If you are using vanilla extract, wait until later to add it, when adding the rum)
Add the sugar and salt to the milk mixture and stir.

Stir the eggs and yolks together with a spatula. Do not beat it. You want to incorporate as little air as possible. I follow Chez Pim''s method and use a strainer to pass the eggs and yolks right into the flour. I know it sounds crazy, but it really works, and you don''t have to press down on the eggs at all, as they are so dense and heavy their own weight will push them through.



When the milk mixture is just a bit warm but not so hot – cool enough to stick your finger in it and keep it there a few seconds without burning yourself – remove the vanilla bean halves. Don’t throw them away! Instead, put them in a plastic bowl/container large enough to hold the batter. Pour the warm milk mixture into the bowl containing the dry ingredients, and gently stir together until well-blended. You’ll see plenty of lumps in the batter, but that’s fine for now.
Strain the lumpy batter into the bowl you put the vanilla bean in earlier, pressing the lumps through until you get a totally lump-free batter. Add the rum (and vanilla extract, if using) and stir until combined.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap (or put a lid on your container) and place in the fridge to rest for at least 24 hours.
When the batter has rested, preheat the oven to 425F and divide it evenly among 12 muffin tins, generously coated with butter. Bake for 45 minutes to an hour. You will have enough batter for another 12 muffins. Bake these the next day. See the difference between 24 hours and 48 hours of rest? I say to do this because fresh cannelés are delicious, and this gives you two rounds of them. If you have two muffins tins to use, go ahead and bake these all at once if you find it more convenient (but in that case, I would give the batter a full 48 hours of rest).
