This is another timing thing for me but it works. \r\n\r\nI always take my steaks out of the fridge at least 30 minutes before I have to cook them and allow them to marinate in a half cup olive oil, 4 tablespoons soy sauce and 4 teaspoons Grill Mates Montreal Steak Seasoning. That marinade recipe is for two good sized steaks but you can easily double it if needed. \r\n\r\nThis gives me time to get my cast ironed skillet and oven heated up and gives the steak time to come to room temperature.\r\nStep 3\r\nSear the Steaks before you Cook Them in The Oven: To cook a steak in the oven that appears to have been cooked on the grill you need to sear it. I prefer to sear mine on the burner by heating the pan over medium high heat and then adding the steaks and turning them after about 4-5 minutes and then searing the other side for an equal amount of time but you could choose to sear them under the broiler. Some people prefer the broiler method because they do not have to turn them. They will sear on both sides because the heat from the broiler and the heat from the pan works together to sear both sides. Either way you are well on your way to cooking a great steak in the oven.\r\nStep 4\r\nCook Steak in The Oven: To cook steak in the oven you have two choices. \r\n\r\nYou can cook them quickly at 450 degrees or you can cook a steak in the oven at 325 degrees. Either way works great. I think timing is everything when it comes to cooking. \r\n\r\nIf I'm just frying potatoes to go with them I set the oven at 450 degrees and they are cooked to a perfect medium in 10 to 12 minutes.\r\n\r\nBut if I'm making baked potatoes I set the oven at 325 degrees which allows them to cook to a perfect medium in 25 to 30 minutes. You just choose which method works best for you and transfer your pan directly into the preheated oven.\r\n"}}

Thick steaks approximately 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 inches thick that weigh between 12 and 16 ounces work best.
Step 2
Marinate Steaks to Cook in The Oven: To cook steak in the oven that has great flavor and is tender it is best to marinate them. This is another timing thing for me but it works. 

I always take my steaks out of the fridge at least 30 minutes before I have to cook them and allow them to marinate in a half cup olive oil, 4 tablespoons soy sauce and 4 teaspoons Grill Mates Montreal Steak Seasoning. That marinade recipe is for two good sized steaks but you can easily double it if needed. 

This gives me time to get my cast ironed skillet and oven heated up and gives the steak time to come to room temperature.
Step 3
Sear the Steaks before you Cook Them in The Oven: To cook a steak in the oven that appears to have been cooked on the grill you need to sear it. I prefer to sear mine on the burner by heating the pan over medium high heat and then adding the steaks and turning them after about 4-5 minutes and then searing the other side for an equal amount of time but you could choose to sear them under the broiler. Some people prefer the broiler method because they do not have to turn them. They will sear on both sides because the heat from the broiler and the heat from the pan works together to sear both sides. Either way you are well on your way to cooking a great steak in the oven.
Step 4
Cook Steak in The Oven: To cook steak in the oven you have two choices. 

You can cook them quickly at 450 degrees or you can cook a steak in the oven at 325 degrees. Either way works great. I think timing is everything when it comes to cooking. 

If I''m just frying potatoes to go with them I set the oven at 450 degrees and they are cooked to a perfect medium in 10 to 12 minutes.

But if I''m making baked potatoes I set the oven at 325 degrees which allows them to cook to a perfect medium in 25 to 30 minutes. You just choose which method works best for you and transfer your pan directly into the preheated oven.

 HYPERLINK "http://www.seasaltwithfood.com/2008/11/kuih-talam-tray-cake.html"Kuih Talam (Tray Cake) 

Kuih Talam consists of two layers of cake. The top layer is made from coconut milk and rice flour and the bottom layer is made from pandan leave extract, mung bean and rice flour. This is another way of using the pandan leaves. The recipes were adapted from "Hot Favorites Kueh" a cookbook published from Malaysia. I have omitted the coloring and alkaline water. They still turned out perfect! 
Ingredients

Bottom Green Layer

1o Pandan Leaves + 1 1/4 cup Water
1/2 tsp Alkaline Water
100g Rice Flour
75g Tapioca Starch
25g Mung Bean Flour 
200g Sugar ( I used 150g)
some green food coloring
600ml Water 

Top White Layer

200ml Thick Coconut Milk
320ml Water (I used 300ml)
50g Rice Flour
20g Tapioca Starch
1/2 tsp Salt

Method

Bottom Layer
Blend the pandan leaves with water to make 1 cup of pandan juice. Add alkaline water.

Sift the rice flour, tapioca starch and mung bean flour. Combine well with pandan juice, sugar and coloring.

Stir over medium heat until the mixture thickens. Pour it into a tray and steam over medium heat for 15 minutes till cooked.

Top Layer
Combine the thick coconut milk with water. Sift the rice flour and tapioca starch. Combine with coconut milk mixture and salt. Strain and stir over a low heat till mixture thickens.

When the bottom layer is cooked, pour in the top layer mixture gradually. Steam over a high heat for about 15 minutes. Remove and leave it to cool. Cut into small pieces and serve.

Bring the pot to a boil over high heat, then immediately turn the heat to low to keep a simmer. Cook for about 30 minutes more (less if youâre using a smaller chicken). Check for doneness by sticking a chopstick into the flesh under the leg and see if the juices run clear or insert a thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh not touching bone.

Donât forget to reserve the poaching broth for your rice, your sauce, and the accompanying soup. The quick cooling will stop the cooking process, keeping the meat soft and tender, and giving the skin a lovely firm texture.\r\n3. To cook the rice: Drain the rice. In a wok or sauce pan (use a medium sauce pan if you plan on cooking the rice on the stove top), heat 2 tablespoons of cooking oil over medium-high heat. When hot, add the ginger and the garlic and fry until your kitchen smells like heaven. Be careful not to burn the aromatics! Add in your drained rice and stir to coat, cook for 2 minutes. Add the sesame oil, mix well.\r\nTo make the rice on the stove: In the same sauce pan, add 2 cups of your reserved poaching broth, add salt and bring to a boil. Immediately turn the heat down to low, cover the pot and cook for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit (with lid still on) for 5-10 minutes more.\r\nTo cook rice in a rice cooker: Pour aromatics and rice (after frying) into your rice cooker, add 2 1/2 cups of your reserved poaching broth and salt.

While your rice is cooking, remove the chicken from the ice bath and rub the outside of the chicken with the sesame oil. Carve the chicken for serving.\r\n5. To make the chili sauce: Blend your chili sauce ingredients in a blender until smooth and bright red.\r\n6. To make the soup: You should have six or seven cups of the reserved poaching broth left over to serve as soup. Just before serving, heat up the soup, taste and season with salt as necessary.\r\nServe the chicken rice with chili sauce, dark soy sauce, cucumber slices, and a bowl of hot broth garnished with cilantro or scallions.\r\n"}}

  Parameters: {"commit"=>"Save", "authenticity_token"=>"Sg/Tz+fzJSk9eWT7kXfJaUFGHqyB1lExD7lhifIIFj8=", "recipe"=>{"contents"=>"Chinese roast pork\r\n2 lbs. pork country style ribs or pork butt, cut into 2-in. chunks and trimmed of excess fat\r\n1/3 c. hoisin sauce\r\n1/3 c. rice wine (I was out and used mirin to great effect)\r\n1/3 c. soy sauce\r\n1 tbs. ketchup\r\n4 garlic cloves, minced\r\n2 tbs. brown sugar\r\nCombine liquid ingredients, garlic, and sugar in a bowl large enough to hold the meat; stir to mix well. Add the meat and turn the pieces to coat. Marinate in fridge 1-3 hours.\r\nIf using a conventional oven, preheat to 400 and line a cookie sheet with foil. If you have an oven-proof rack or broiling tray that will fit in the sheet, set it in or over the sheet.\r\nIf using an electric skillet, preheat to 400 and place a small rack inside the pan (foil isn't necessary if your nonstick coating is good).\r\nCarefully remove the meat from the marinade, reserving the marinade, and place the pieces onto the rack. Place in the oven or the skillet (close the lid) and roast for 20 minutes. (When using the electric skillet, I found that there was a lot of sauce dripping onto the pan and starting to burn during the first 20 minutes.

1/3 c. soy sauce
1 tbs. ketchup
4 garlic cloves, minced
2 tbs. brown sugar
Combine liquid ingredients, garlic, and sugar in a bowl large enough to hold the meat; stir to mix well. Add the meat and turn the pieces to coat. Marinate in fridge 1-3 hours.
If using a conventional oven, preheat to 400 and line a cookie sheet with foil. If you have an oven-proof rack or broiling tray that will fit in the sheet, set it in or over the sheet.
If using an electric skillet, preheat to 400 and place a small rack inside the pan (foil isn''t necessary if your nonstick coating is good).
Carefully remove the meat from the marinade, reserving the marinade, and place the pieces onto the rack. Place in the oven or the skillet (close the lid) and roast for 20 minutes. (When using the electric skillet, I found that there was a lot of sauce dripping onto the pan and starting to burn during the first 20 minutes. I just removed the rack with the meat and lifted off the sauce with a spatula.)

Stir in the flour, adding an extra tablespoon or two of flour if the dough seems sticky. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in size, about 1-1/2 hours. (If using a bread machine, dump the sponge in the pan and add the other ingredients. Select dough or manual cycle. Leave the top of the machine up, and watch as the dough forms. Add flour if needed. Put the top down and let the machine continue to mix, knead and complete one rise.)\r\nPunch the dough down and divide in half. Shape into two rectangles. Roll one rectangle from the long side and pinch the seam together with your fingers. Repeat with the other rectangle. Leave the two loaves on the work surface and cover with plastic wrap for 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees. Grease a baking sheet with shortening. Pick up each loaf and stretch gently as you place it on the baking sheet. Sprinkle the loaves lightly with flour. Cover again and let rise 20 minutes. Using a serrated knife, cut three or four diagonal slashes about 3/4-inch deep across the top of each loaf. Bake about 20 minutes, until lightly browned. Cool 15 minutes before cutting.\r\n\r\nAs this is a fat-free bread, it has a short shelf life. Use it on the day it is prepared or freeze in plastic freezer bags. To reheat, thaw on the counter in the bag. Remove from the bag and heat 8 to 10 minutes on a baking sheet in a 350-degree oven."}}

Please note that this recipe uses all-purpose flour, rather than bread flour. For the sponge:

1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1-1/2	teaspoons active dry yeast
1	cup lukewarm water
Combine the flour and yeast in a mixing bowl. Stir in the water. The mixture will be very thick. Cover with plastic wrap or a cup towel and leave at room temperature for 4 hours or overnight, but not longer than 12 hours.
To prepare the dough:

3	tablespoons lukewarm water
1-1/2	teaspoons salt
1-3/4	cups all-purpose flour, approximately
Add the water and salt to the sponge. Stir in the flour, adding an extra tablespoon or two of flour if the dough seems sticky. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in size, about 1-1/2 hours. (If using a bread machine, dump the sponge in the pan and add the other ingredients. Select dough or manual cycle. Leave the top of the machine up, and watch as the dough forms. Add flour if needed. Put the top down and let the machine continue to mix, knead and complete one rise.)
Punch the dough down and divide in half. Shape into two rectangles. Roll one rectangle from the long side and pinch the seam together with your fingers. Repeat with the other rectangle. Leave the two loaves on the work surface and cover with plastic wrap for 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Grease a baking sheet with shortening. Pick up each loaf and stretch gently as you place it on the baking sheet. Sprinkle the loaves lightly with flour. Cover again and let rise 20 minutes. Using a serrated knife, cut three or four diagonal slashes about 3/4-inch deep across the top of each loaf. Bake about 20 minutes, until lightly browned. Cool 15 minutes before cutting.

As this is a fat-free bread, it has a short shelf life. Use it on the day it is prepared or freeze in plastic freezer bags. To reheat, thaw on the counter in the bag. Remove from the bag and heat 8 to 10 minutes on a baking sheet in a 350-degree oven.')[0m

Tips:

I generally use about 5 medium size bananas but have used a little as three and it still came out good. If you like a lighter cake or muffin type bread, look elsewhere. Mix the ingredients carefully; I use my mixer to cream the butter and sugar and incorporate the eggs, but for the bananas and flour mixture I use a wooden spoon and mix gently until everything has just come together. I also add about 3/4 to 1 cup of chopped walnuts. 350 degrees for 1 hour, 15 minutes works for me but it is extremely important that I watch where my oven racks are positioned, too high in the oven and the bottom will not bake correctly, too low and it burns before the middle it cooked through. I position my rack one notch lower than direct middle of my oven and it comes out perfectly.

if the bread seems dry and dense, chances are you stirred it too much, which is easy to do without even thinking about it. With sweet breads and muffins, you should always just stir to moisten. ')[0m

In separate bowl add the water, tapioca flour, and baking powder and mix. It will foam and bubble up--that's normal.  Fold this into the pork mixture. It will be quite moist. Cover and allow to rest at least 6 hrs, but preferably over night in the fridge.\r\n\r\nWhen ready to cook, grind the mixture one more time in small batches in your food processor.

 3 tb Water
 1/2 tb Potato starch or rice flour

 Sprinkling of freshly

 2 oz Pork fat
 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
 
 This recipe is very tasty with an interesting texture.
 Unless you''re a fan of hard work, use a food
 processor. The pate was originally pounded to the
 proper consistency in a mortar and pestle... It can
 be used all sorts of ways++made into balls for soup,
 sliced after cooking and added to lettuce or rice
 paper rolls, served with shrimp chips for
 munchies++whatever inspires you. The cinnamon flavor
 is discernible but not overpowering. I''ve actually
 made this recipe and found it to be a keeper.
 
 Be sure pork is trimmed of all fat. Slice the meat
 1/4 inch thick, then cut into 1 inch squares. Make a
 marinade by combining all the remaining ingredients,
 except for the pork fat and cinnamon, in a large bowl.
 Add the pork slices to the marinade and mix well with
 your hands, then cover the bowl with wrap or foil.
 Refrigerate for 5 hours, and after that period of time
 has elapsed, transfer the bowl to the freezer for 10
 minutes.
 
 Remove the pork from the freezer, add the cinnamon,
 and reduce to a paste in a food processor only.
 
 Boil the pork fat for 10 minutes and dice into small
 pieces, the size of whole peppercorns. Add the diced
 pork fat to the ground pork mixture.
 
 Coat an 8-inch-square baking pan with oil. Put the
 meat paste into the pan and press down firmly with
 your hands, making sure the surface is smooth. The
 meat will come halfway up the side of the pan.
 
 Preheat the oven to 350F and bake the pate for 40
 minutes or until the surface looks brown. Remove from
 the oven and allow to cool. Then slice and serve as
 an appetizer or with French bread for lunch or dinner,
 or use in any recipe where it is required. It can be
 eaten hot or cold.
 
 This will keep fresh in the refrigerator for a week,
 or it can be stored for a longer period in the
 freezer. To reheat, wrap in foil and place in a 300F
 oven for 15 minutes.

If you've made the dough in a bowl that's not at least 6-quart capacity, transfer it to a large\r\nbowl; it's going to rise a lot. There's no need to grease the bowl, though you can if you like; it makes it\r\na bit easier to get the dough out when it's time to bake bread.\r\n\r\n4) Cover the bowl or bucket, and let the dough rise at room temperature for 2 hours. Then refrigerate\r\nit for at least 2 hours, or for up to about 7 days. (If you're pressed for time, skip the room-temperature\r\nrise, and stick it right into the fridge). The longer you keep it in the fridge, the tangier it'll get; if you\r\nchill it for 7 days, it will taste like sourdough. Over the course of the first day or so, it'll rise, then fall.\r\nThat's OK; that's what it's supposed to do.\r\n\r\n5) When you're ready to make bread, sprinkle the top of the dough with flour; this will make it easier\r\nto grab a hunk. Grease your hands, and pull off about 1/4 to 1/3 of the dough â a 14-ounce to 19-\r\nounce piece, if you have a scale. It'll be about the size of a softball, or a large grapefruit.\r\n\r\n6) Plop the sticky dough onto a floured work surface, and round it into a ball, or a longer log.

Directions

1) Combine all of the ingredients in a large mixing bowl, or a large (6-quart), food-safe plastic bucket.
For first-timers, "lukewarm" means about 105Â°F, but don''t stress over getting the temperatures exact
here. Comfortably warm is fine; "OUCH, that''s hot!" is not. Yeast is a living thing; treat it nicely.

2) Mix and stir everything together to make a very sticky, rough dough. If you have a stand mixer,
beat at medium speed with the beater blade for 30 to 60 seconds. If you don''t have a mixer, just stir-
stir-stir with a big spoon or dough whisk till everything is combined.

3) Next, you''re going to let the dough rise. If you''ve made the dough in a plastic bucket, you''re all set
â just let it stay there, covering the bucket with a lid or plastic wrap; a shower cap actually works
well here. If you''ve made the dough in a bowl that''s not at least 6-quart capacity, transfer it to a large
bowl; it''s going to rise a lot. There''s no need to grease the bowl, though you can if you like; it makes it
a bit easier to get the dough out when it''s time to bake bread.

4) Cover the bowl or bucket, and let the dough rise at room temperature for 2 hours. Then refrigerate
it for at least 2 hours, or for up to about 7 days. (If you''re pressed for time, skip the room-temperature
rise, and stick it right into the fridge). The longer you keep it in the fridge, the tangier it''ll get; if you
chill it for 7 days, it will taste like sourdough. Over the course of the first day or so, it''ll rise, then fall.
That''s OK; that''s what it''s supposed to do.

5) When you''re ready to make bread, sprinkle the top of the dough with flour; this will make it easier
to grab a hunk. Grease your hands, and pull off about 1/4 to 1/3 of the dough â a 14-ounce to 19-
ounce piece, if you have a scale. It''ll be about the size of a softball, or a large grapefruit.

6) Plop the sticky dough onto a floured work surface, and round it into a ball, or a longer log. Don''t
fuss around trying to make it perfect; just do the best you can.

7) Place the dough on a piece of parchment (if you''re going to use a baking stone); or onto a lightly
greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Sift a light coating of flour over the top; this will help keep

the dough moist as it rests before baking.

8) Let the dough rise for about 45 to 60 minutes. It won''t appear to rise upwards that much; rather, it''ll
seem to settle and expand. Preheat your oven (and baking stone, if you''re using one) to 450Â°F while
the dough rests. Place a shallow metal or cast iron pan (not glass, Pyrex, or ceramic) on the lowest
oven rack, and have 1 cup of hot water ready to go.

9) When you''re ready to bake, take a sharp knife and slash the bread 2 or 3 times, making a cut about
1/2" deep. The bread may deflate a bit; that''s OK, it''ll pick right up in the hot oven.

10) Place the bread in the oven, and carefully pour the 1 cup hot water into the shallow pan on the rack
beneath. It''ll bubble and steam; close the oven door quickly.

11) Bake the bread for 25 to 35 minutes, until it''s a deep, golden brown.

12) Remove the bread from the oven, and cool it on a rack. Store leftover bread in a plastic bag at
room temperature.

13) Yield: 3 or 4 loaves, depending on size.')[0m

If you measure flour by sprinkling it into your measuring cup, then gently sweeping off the excess, use 7 1/2 cups. If you measure flour by dipping your cup into the canister, then sweeping off the excess, use 6 1/2 cups. Most accurate of all, and guaranteed to give you the best results, if you measure flour by weight, use 32 ounces.\r\n1) Combine all of the ingredients in a large mixing bowl, or a large (6-quart), food-safe plastic bucket. For first-timers, \"lukewarm\" means about 105Â°F, but don't stress over getting the temperatures exact here. Comfortably warm is fine; \"OUCH, that's hot!\" is not. Yeast is a living thing; treat it nicely.\r\n2) Mix and stir everything together to make a very sticky, rough dough. If you have a stand mixer, beat at medium speed with the beater blade for 30 to 60 seconds. If you don't have a mixer, just stir-stir-stir with a big spoon or dough whisk till everything is combined.\r\n3) Next, you're going to let the dough rise. If you've made the dough in a plastic bucket, you're all set â just let it stay there, covering the bucket with a lid or plastic wrap; a shower cap actually works well here. If you've made the dough in a bowl that's not at least 6-quart capacity, transfer it to a large bowl; it's going to rise a lot. There's no need to grease the bowl, though you can if you like; it makes it a bit easier to get the dough out when it's time to bake bread.\r\n4) Cover the bowl or bucket, and let the dough rise at room temperature for 2 hours. Then refrigerate it for at least 2 hours, or for up to about 7 days. (If you're pressed for time, skip the room-temperature rise, and stick it right into the fridge). The longer you keep it in the fridge, the tangier it'll get; if you chill it for 7 days, it will taste like sourdough. Over the course of the first day or so, it'll rise, then fall. That's OK; that's what it's supposed to do.\r\n5) When you're ready to make bread, sprinkle the top of the dough with flour; this will make it easier to grab a hunk. Grease your hands, and pull off about 1/4 to 1/3 of the dough â a 14-ounce to 19-ounce piece, if you have a scale. It'll be about the size of a softball, or a large grapefruit.\r\n6) Plop the sticky dough onto a floured work surface, and round it into a ball, or a longer log. Don't fuss around trying to make it perfect; just do the best you can.\r\n7) Place the dough on a piece of parchment (if you're going to use a baking stone); or onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Sift a light coating of flour over the top; this will help keep the dough moist as it rests before baking.\r\n8) Let the dough rise for about 45 to 60 minutes. It won't appear to rise upwards that much; rather, it'll seem to settle and expand. Preheat your oven (and baking stone, if you're using one) to 450Â°F while the dough rests. Place a shallow metal or cast iron pan (not glass, Pyrex, or ceramic) on the lowest oven rack, and have 1 cup of hot water ready to go.\r\n9) When you're ready to bake, take a sharp knife and slash the bread 2 or 3 times, making a cut about 1/2\" deep. The bread may deflate a bit; that's OK, it'll pick right up in the hot oven.\r\n10) Place the bread in the oven, and carefully pour the 1 cup hot water into the shallow pan on the rack beneath. It'll bubble and steam; close the oven door quickly.\r\n11) Bake the bread for 25 to 35 minutes, until it's a deep, golden brown.\r\n12) Remove the bread from the oven, and cool it on a rack. Store leftover bread in a plastic bag at room temperature.\r\n13) Yield: 3 or 4 loaves, depending on size."}}

Directions

This recipe''s Ingredients were scaled to yield a new amount. The directions below still refer to the original recipe yield of 1 tube cake.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Wash a 10 inch angel food tube pan in hot soapy water to ensure it is totally grease free.
Measure flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into sifter. Sift into bowl. Make a well; add oil, egg yolks, water, vanilla, and lemon flavoring to the well in the order that is given. Set aside. Don''t beat.
In a large mixing bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar until very stiff. Set aside.
Using same beaters, beat egg yolk batter until smooth and light. Pour gradually over egg whites, folding in with rubber spatula. Do not stir. Pour batter into angel food tube pan.
Bake for 55 minutes. Increase heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake 10 to 15 minutes until done. Invert pan until cool.

Tips:

Also, when beating the whites, the highest speed to be used should be medium. 2) Mixing the yolk mixture first may be more beneficial if you tend to be a slow mixer. If the stiffened egg whites sit too long, they begin to "melt" or "re-liquify". 3)When folding the two mixtures together, be sure there are no lumps or streaks. This may sound obvious, but for newbies like me this is important to know. 4) Last but not least, if you''re baking in two round pans rather than a big tube pan, watch the cakes carefully as they cook. They are guaranteed to burn or fail if they''re in the oven for 55 minutes. I timed the cakes for 20 minutes and checked every ten minutes after that. I think it was a total of 40 minutes to create perfection. ^-^

Directions

This recipe''s Ingredients were scaled to yield a new amount. The directions below still refer to the original recipe yield of 1 tube cake.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Wash a 10 inch angel food tube pan in hot soapy water to ensure it is totally grease free.
Measure flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into sifter. Sift into bowl. Make a well; add oil, egg yolks, water, vanilla to the well in the order that is given. Set aside. Don''t beat.
In a large mixing bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar until very stiff. Set aside.
Using same beaters, beat egg yolk batter until smooth and light. Pour gradually over egg whites, folding in with rubber spatula. Do not stir. Pour batter into angel food tube pan.
Bake for 55 minutes. Increase heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake 10 to 15 minutes until done. Invert pan until cool.

Tips:

Also, when beating the whites, the highest speed to be used should be medium. 2) Mixing the yolk mixture first may be more beneficial if you tend to be a slow mixer. If the stiffened egg whites sit too long, they begin to "melt" or "re-liquify". 3)When folding the two mixtures together, be sure there are no lumps or streaks. This may sound obvious, but for newbies like me this is important to know. 4) Last but not least, if you''re baking in two round pans rather than a big tube pan, watch the cakes carefully as they cook. They are guaranteed to burn or fail if they''re in the oven for 55 minutes. I timed the cakes for 20 minutes and checked every ten minutes after that. I think it was a total of 40 minutes to create perfection. ^-^

  Parameters: {"commit"=>"Save", "authenticity_token"=>"N8sbbFPVDZnS2EpilYyWY2wAriQGTzmCH/c7402Yi34=", "recipe"=>{"contents"=>"banh xeo vietnamese sizzling crepes\r\nFillings\r\n1 /2 lb pork butt, cut into thin slices\r\n1/2 ts salt\r\n1/2 ts sugar\r\n1/2 ts fish sauce\r\nblack pepper\r\n1/2 lb of shrimp (medium to large size, deveined and peeled)\r\n1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced\r\n3 cups of bean sprouts (in small bowl wrapped in plastic wrap, steam small batches in the microwave for about 1-2 minutes, drain and set aside)\r\nBatter\r\n1 package of banh xeo mix (basically rice flour either with turmeric pre-mixed or separate--we used the package above, but many brands are available)\r\n3 cups of water or beer\r\n1 cup of coconut milk\r\n1 cup of chopped scallions\r\n1/2 ts salt\r\nAccompaniments\r\nWhole green lettuce leafs, mint, perilla, basil,\r\nnuoc mam cham\r\npickled carrots and daikon\r\nsmall bowl of cooking oil\r\nIn a mixing bowl, combine banh xeo mix, coconut milk, and beer and mix well. Let the ingredients meld together for about 20 minutes and add green onions. Marinate the pork with salt, pepper, sugar, and fish sauce and set aside. Season shrimp with touch of salt and pepper and set aside.\r\n\r\nBefore starting to pour your crepes, make sure you have have plenty of counter space and line up all your ingredients ready to go--largest nonstick pan you have, a ladle and flexible spatula, batter, pork, shrimp, onions, and small bowl of cooking oil.\r\nOn high heat, heat 1 teaspoon of cooking oil in a nonstick frying pan and sautee a few pieces of pork--when it's about 1/3rd of of the way done, add onion slices and shrimps since they are quicker to cook. Distribute the shrimps and pork evenly prior to adding the batter. Don't use too much filling--you don't want to overload the crepes.\r\n\r\nStir batter with ladle and add about 3/4 quarter ladle full into the center of the pan and quickly swirl the pan to evenly distribute a thin layer batter to the very edges of the pan. Try to go for as thin a layer as possible. You may have to adjust how much batter you use depending on how big your pan is.\r\n\r\nPlace a lid over for about 1.5 minutes or so. When you check the crepe notice that the area of uncooked batter in the center will get smaller and smaller (see above).

Fillings
1 /2 lb pork butt, cut into thin slices
1/2 ts salt
1/2 ts sugar
1/2 ts fish sauce
black pepper
1/2 lb of shrimp (medium to large size, deveined and peeled)
1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced
3 cups of bean sprouts (in small bowl wrapped in plastic wrap, steam small batches in the microwave for about 1-2 minutes, drain and set aside)
Batter
1 package of banh xeo mix (basically rice flour either with turmeric pre-mixed or separate--we used the package above, but many brands are available)
3 cups of water or beer
1 cup of coconut milk
1 cup of chopped scallions
1/2 ts salt
Accompaniments
Whole green lettuce leafs, mint, perilla, basil,
nuoc mam cham
pickled carrots and daikon
small bowl of cooking oil
In a mixing bowl, combine banh xeo mix, coconut milk, and beer and mix well. Let the ingredients meld together for about 20 minutes and add green onions. Marinate the pork with salt, pepper, sugar, and fish sauce and set aside. Season shrimp with touch of salt and pepper and set aside.

Before starting to pour your crepes, make sure you have have plenty of counter space and line up all your ingredients ready to go--largest nonstick pan you have, a ladle and flexible spatula, batter, pork, shrimp, onions, and small bowl of cooking oil.
On high heat, heat 1 teaspoon of cooking oil in a nonstick frying pan and sautee a few pieces of pork--when it''s about 1/3rd of of the way done, add onion slices and shrimps since they are quicker to cook. Distribute the shrimps and pork evenly prior to adding the batter. Don''t use too much filling--you don''t want to overload the crepes.

Stir batter with ladle and add about 3/4 quarter ladle full into the center of the pan and quickly swirl the pan to evenly distribute a thin layer batter to the very edges of the pan. Try to go for as thin a layer as possible. You may have to adjust how much batter you use depending on how big your pan is.

Place a lid over for about 1.5 minutes or so. When you check the crepe notice that the area of uncooked batter in the center will get smaller and smaller (see above). When the crepe is almost completely cooked, the edges of the crepe start to curl up a bit and turn golden brown. Now take another small amount of cooking oil in a spoon distribute oil around the edges so the crepe gets crispy, won''t burn, and will be easier to flip.

Now add the pre-steamed beansprouts to one side of the crepe. Turn the heat down to medium heat and place the lid over for another 1 minute or until gold brown. Using the flexible spatula carefully flip over the other half. When golden and nicely browned, don''t try to lift the crepe out of the pan with a spatula....just tilt the pan and slide the crepe over to a plate and serve immediately. When pouring the next crepe, add more oil as needed.

Enjoy with plenty of lettuce, mints, basil, and perilla. You can either break off small pieces of banh xeo and form lettuce wraps or combine all the herbs and break off some banh xeo and eat in a bowl. Some Vietnamese even wrap the banh xeo spring roll style with rice paper. Dip or dress with nuoc mam cham dipping sauce along with pickled carrots and daikon.

2 Cornish hens (bone in, skin on and split in half, lengthwise--if using chicken, bone in and skin on thighs work best)
2 tablespoons of soy sauce
1 teaspoon of five spice powder
1 tablespoon of honey
1 teaspoon of black pepper
1 teaspoon of white pepper
1 teaspoon of sesame oil
1 teaspoon of minced garlic
3 tbs diced green onions
2 tbs cooking oil
Rice, tomatoes, cucumbers
Dipping Sauce
Juice from roasted chicken
lime wedges
chili garlic sauce or thai red chilies
soy sauce
In a mixing bowl, combine soy sauce, five spice powder, honey, peppers, sesame oil and garlic along with the cornish hen and mix well. Cover and marinate the cornish hens preferably overnight, but a 3-4 hours will probably still do.

Preheat oven for 350 degrees. Place in baking pan and bake hens in middle rack with skin facing up. In the meantime, heat the cooking oil and add the green onions and remove from heat and set aside.

Bake for about a half an hour or until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees or poke and juices run clear. The baking pan will contain the juices and marinade. DO NOT throw this out! Take the juices and add a little soy sauce, squeeze of some lime, and garlic chili sauce or Thai peppers for a great dipping sauce.

For extra crispiness, you can quickly sear the skin on high heat in a heavy skillet right before serving. Serve with tomatoes, cucumber, and rice.')[0m

To make the stock, add pork bones and cover with water and bring to boil for about 2-4 minutes. Empty the water along with the gunk and residue and save bones in colander. Clean bones, rinse well, and drain. Also, clean the stock pot before adding the bones back in with about 12 cups of water. Add shallot and chicken and bring to rolling boil and reduce heat. Remove chicken after about 20 min to 1/2 hr (depending your the cut you use and how big) and cover with saran wrap and set aside to cool. Continue to simmer the broth under low heat for about 2 hrs, skimming off fat, froth, and any residual gunk from the broth. Then add, a few dried shrimps, sugar, fish sauce, and salt to taste.

Serve with chopped green onion/cilantro and fresh ground pepper.

Pork broth

4 pounds of pork spareribs
12 cups of water

This is just a rough generic recipe for all of our pork based soups on the site. In a large pot, put pork spareribs with water and bring to boil then reduce heat to medium low. Simmer for about 1.5 hours. Skim off the scum of fat while simmering. Bones can be discarded and the pot of broth can be left to cool. Remove excess hardened fat from the top surface.

Use a 4-cup pan, like a high-sided (with a 2\" wall) 8-inch round or square, or an 11\" x 17\" sponge sheet. To prepare the pan, smear a bit of softened butter to lightly coat the bottom and side. Line the bottom with parchment paper. Smear the parchment paper with a bit more butter. Add Â¼ to Â½ cup all-purpose flour (depending on the size of the pan) and shake and turn the pan around to coat it. Standing over the sink, invert and tap the pan to remove excess flour. Set aside.\r\n\r\nNow put a rack in the lower third position and preheat to 350F. Then, have your mixer (or whisk) and rubber spatula handy. Finally, gather the ingredients and organize yourself so you can move swiftly and smoothly through the process.\r\n\r\nFor egg yolk batter base:\r\n3 large egg yolks, placed in a metal bowls, about 3-quart capacity\r\nÂ½ cup sugar\r\n1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\r\n\r\nFor egg whites:\r\n3 large egg whites, place in a metal bowl, 2-3-quart capacity\r\nPinch of salt, non-iodized table salt, preferred\r\nScant Â¼ teaspoon cream of tartar \r\n1 1/2 tablespoons sugar\r\n\r\nFor finishing the batter:\r\n1/3 cup plus Â¼ cup cake flour (such as Swans Down brand) scooped and leveled into a sifter set over a piece of parchment or plate (measure 1/3 cup then measure 1/4 cup for 7/12 cup total!)\r\n3 tablespoons tepid melted, unsalted butter (keep cooled butter on stove to avoid solidification)\r\n\r\n1. Start beating the egg yolks in the bowl. Gradually sprinkle in the sugar by the tablespoon to incorporate well. (Do this too fast and the batter will be grainy with sugar.) Continue beating for several minutes, until the mixture is thick, pale yellow, and when you pause and lift the whisk (or beaters), the batter drips down and forms a ribbon that slowly dissolves on the surface. Now, beat in the vanilla. Set aside.\r\n\r\n2. Wash and dry the whisk (or beaters) well.\r\n\r\n3. Start beating the egg whites. When they are foamy throughout, sprinkle in the salt and cream of tartar. Continue beating until soft peaks form (when the whisk (or beaters) is lifted out of the egg whites, a soft, slightly bent over peak of egg white forms in the bowl). As you beat, the whites will have gone from clear to light grey to solid white. Instead of sliding from the walls of the bowl, they will stick to the bowl.\r\n\r\nAfter soft peaks form, sprinkle in the 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar and continue beating for a couple more minutes to generate stiff egg whites (the peak stands straight when the whisk is lifted from the bowl). The whites will have a sheen.\r\n\r\n4. Immediately take a large rubber spatula and plop a Â¼ of the egg whites into the egg yolk base. Stir gently to lighten the base. Then plop 1/3 of the remaining whites onto the base. Sift Â¼ of the flour on top. Delicately and quickly use the spatula to fold the ingredients together, until they are nearly all incorporated. (To fold, plunge the spatula sideways - like a knife - into the center of the batter, touching bottom. Rapidly bring the spatula to the wall of the bowl and rotate it to scoop up and fold the batter over the whites and flour.

Fold again until nearly blended. At that point, pour in the melted butter in a circle. Quickly fold it into the batter (do not overblend or the batter will deflate). The finished batter will be pale yellow, very thick, and light feeling.\r\n\r\n5. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. It should fill to about Â¼ inch of the rim. Scoop out extra batter to avoid overflow during baking.\r\n\r\n6. Use the spatula to spread the batter out evenly in the pan. Tilt the pan in all direction to slightly push the batter toward the rim. This prevents a domed-center during baking.\r\n\r\n7. Gently slide the cake into the oven. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. The cake will rise slowly and then brown.

(It will deflate and pull away from the pan walls.) Run a knife all around the edge, between the cake and the pan. Invert the cake onto your hand (or back on the rack), give the cake bottom a tap, and then remove the cake pan. Peel off the parchment paper and discard. Invert the cake, top side up, onto the rack.

3 large egg yolks, placed in a metal bowls, about 3-quart capacity
Â½ cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

For egg whites:
3 large egg whites, place in a metal bowl, 2-3-quart capacity
Pinch of salt, non-iodized table salt, preferred
Scant Â¼ teaspoon cream of tartar 
1 1/2 tablespoons sugar

For finishing the batter:
1/3 cup plus Â¼ cup cake flour (such as Swans Down brand) scooped and leveled into a sifter set over a piece of parchment or plate (measure 1/3 cup then measure 1/4 cup for 7/12 cup total!)
3 tablespoons tepid melted, unsalted butter (keep cooled butter on stove to avoid solidification)

Notes and Variations

When baking the cake in advance, slip it into a zip-top bag after it has cooled. Refrigerate it for 2 to 3 days or freeze it for several weeks.
Finely grated citrus zest may be added to the egg yolk base. Substitute it for the vanilla or work it in along with the vanilla. About 1 1/2 teaspoons will do.
You may omit the melted butter, if you like a lighter, more spongy, chewier result.
Sift some ground spice or cocoa powder in with the cake flour for flavor variation.

4-5 large onions, about 4 pounds, red and/or sweet
2-4 sprigs fresh thyme
3-5 bay leaves (oops, forgot them in the photo)
3-5 cloves garlic, minced
kosher salt
fresh ground black pepper
flour, about 1/4 cup (see note below)
1-2 cups wine
8 ounces beef broth

Directions
I decided to make this because I had a container of beef broth in the freezer. I had kept the drippings from the Christmas rib roast, the pot roast, every time I cooked beef for a month it went into the freezer. You can do it with canned beef broth, but try to find one with as few additives as possible.

Start by prepping the onions. Cut off both ends and cut them in half.

 

Peel the outer layer, then cut into thin strips.

 

Melt a few tablespoons of butter or fat (Iâm using bacon fat) in a dutch oven over medium heat.



Add the onion, minced garlic, bay leaves and thyme and set heat to medium-low.

 
 

Cook until the onions start to turn translucent without mixing them.



Oops, forgot to add salt and pepper.

 

Turn the onions a few times to make sure everything gets some time on the bottom to caramelize. Donât worry too much about burning the onions. All that burned on goodness is going to be pure flavor. Thatâs what the wine is for. Use it to scrape up everything off the bottom, then cook the onions for several minutes, stirring frequently, until most of the wine is cooked off.

 

Some people insist it has to be white. Some insist it has to be red. Since Iâm not a wine drinker, I donât really have a preference. So I used the bottle that was open.

The thyme and bay leaves should have given up all their flavor by now, so go ahead and fish them out.



Add a little flour to the onions and cook for about 5-10 minutes, until the dry flour taste is cooked out.



Start with just enough flour to just coat the onions lightly, only a couple of tablespoons. Hold the rest in reserve until you add the broth and see if it has thickened enough, or if it needs more.

Now add the beef broth. Since mine was very concentrated, I did four ounces of broth and four ounces of water.

 

Simmer for another 20 minutes to a half-hour to reduce the liquid and concentrate the flavor. Ladle into oven safe bowls and add croutons to the top.



The croutons are to keep the cheese from sinking. Lots of recipes call for gruyere, which is crazy expensive. I like a slice of swiss and a slice of provolone.



Put the baking sheet with the bowls on it under the broiler for a couple of minutes* until the cheese is bubbling and starting to brown on the edges.



* NOTE: When I said âa couple of minutesâ I forgot that not everyone has used the broiler before. MissFoxxy left hers in a little too long and discovered you can set cheese on fire. Donât walk away from it, and check frequently.

Be careful, the cheese will hold the heat in really well, so itâs going to stay hot until you dig in.')[0m

Heat a large skillet on medium low heat. Add the strips of bacon or the slices of Canadian bacon. Slowly fry, turning occasionally, until the bacon is browned on both sides, and if using strip bacon, much of the fat is rendered out (about 10 minutes). Use tongs or a fork to remove the bacon from the pan, set on a paper towel to absorb the excess fat. Don't pour the bacon fat left in the pan down the drain! Either sop it up with paper towels when it has cooled a bit, or pour it into a jar to be used later (see rendering bacon fat).\r\n2 While the bacon is cooking, bring a larage saucepan two-thirds-filled with water to a boil, then add the vinegar. Bring the water to a boil again, then lower the heat to a bare simmer.\r\n3 Make the blender hollandaise. To make blender hollandaise, melt 10 Tbsp unsalted butter. Put 3 egg yolks, a tablespoon of lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender, blend on medium to medium high speed for 20-30 seconds, until eggs lighten in color. Turn blender down to lowest setting, slowly dribble in the hot melted butter, while continuing to blend.

Here is an easy method for poaching eggs. Essentially, working one egg at a time you crack an egg into a small bowl and slip it into the barely simmering water. Once it begins to solidify, you can slip in another egg, until you have all four cooking. Turn off the heat, cover the pan, and let sit for 4 minutes. (Remember which egg went in first, you'll want to take it out first.) When it comes time to remove the eggs, gently lift out with a slotted spoon. Note that the timing is a little variable on the eggs, depending on the size of your pan, how much water, how many eggs, and how runny you like them. You might have to experiment a little with your set-up to figure out what you need to do to get the eggs exactly the way you like them.\r\n5 As soon as all the eggs are in the poaching water, begin toasting your English muffins. If you canât get all the muffins toasted by the time the eggs are ready, gently remove the eggs from the poaching water and set in a bowl.\r\n6 To assemble the eggs benedict, butter one side of an English muffin. Top with two slices of bacon or 1 slice of Canadian bacon. You can trim the bacon to fit the muffin if youâd like. Put a poached egg on top of the bacon, then pour some hollandaise over.

1 First bring water in a saucepan to almost boiling. If the water is already boiling, lower the heat until it is no longer boiling. At this point, you can add one or two teaspoons of vinegar to the water, if you want. The vinegar will help the egg whites to congeal more easily. We use seasoned rice vinegar.

3 Turn off the heat. Cover. Let sit for 4 minutes, until the egg whites are cooked.
4 Lift eggs out of pan with a slotted spoon.
One trick to make the eggs stay somewhat contained is to take a ring from a mason jar and place it in the pan. Drop the egg over the mason jar ring and let it settle in the ring, then turn off the heat and cover.
Alternatively, the truly easiest way to make poached eggs is with an egg poacher.
Remove the cups you plan to use. Fill the bottom of the pan with 1/2 an inch of water. Bring to a boil. Crack an egg into one of the stick-free egg cups. Place in the cup holder in the pan. Cover. Wait 3-4 minutes and remove from heat. Lift up the handle of the egg cup and slide the poached egg out onto a plate.
